The Thieves Guild is a secretive organization in Skyrim dedicated to criminal activities, including burglary, pickpocketing, and smuggling.

The guild''s influence has spread across Skyrim, with members adhering to a code that discourages murder, unnecessary violence, and the targeting of the poor. Over the years, local authorities have tolerated the guild, benefiting from bribes and the guild''s role in regulating crime.

The guild offers many benefits to its members, such as specialized training, access to rare items, and opportunities to rise in rank. Those who advance within the guild may even become Nightingales, sworn to serve Nocturnal, the Daedric Prince of Night and Darkness.

Known for their powerful intellects and agile physiques, Dunmer make excellent warriors and sorcerers, seamlessly blending swordplay, archery, and destructive magic in combat. Their long lifespans, often extending beyond two centuries, enable them to hone their abilities, with some of the oldest Dunmer mages living for over five hundred years or more through mystical rituals.

Dunmer society is typically seen as grim, aloof, and harsh by outsiders, who often perceive them as clannish and ruthless. Loyalty to family and clan is of utmost importance in their culture, and they have a reputation for quick tempers and a deep-seated distrust of other races.

The crisis was ignited by the assassination of Emperor Uriel Septim VII and his heirs, leading to the opening of Oblivion Gates across the continent, through which Daedra emerged in overwhelming numbers. These gates were facilitated by the Mythic Dawn, a fanatical cult devoted to Mehrunes Dagon, resulting in widespread devastation throughout various provinces. Key regions such as Skyrim faced brutal sieges, while Kvatch in Cyrodiil was completely destroyed. The Argonians of Black Marsh, called upon by the Hist, mounted a successful counter-offensive against the Daedra, forcing them to close their gates in that region.

Despite the turmoil, the Empire struggled to maintain order, with significant forces withdrawn from provinces like Morrowind, leaving Cyrodiil largely defenseless. Amidst this chaos, Martin Septim, the last heir of the Septim bloodline, emerged as a pivotal figure. He joined forces with a hero of destiny to confront the Daedric threat. In a climactic sacrifice, Martin transformed into an Avatar of Akatosh, utilizing the power of the Amulet of Kings to banish Mehrunes Dagon back to Oblivion, thus ending the crisis and marking the conclusion of the Third Era.', '''3e'':32B ''433'':33B ''across'':56B ''against'':119B ''akatosh'':192B ''also'':6B ''amidst'':152B ''amulet'':198B ''an'':189B ''and'':23B,46B,212B ''anguish'':11B ''argonians'':104B ''as'':8B,91B,165B ''assassination'':40B ''avat'':190B ''back'':205B ''banish'':202B ''beginning'':28B ''betw'':16B ''black'':106B ''bloodlin'':163B ''brutal'':94B ''by'':38B,70B,110B ''call'':108B ''catastrophic'':14B ''cha'':154B ''climactic'':184B ''clos'':125B ''completely'':101B ''conclusion'':215B ''conflict'':15B ''confront'':178B ''continent'':58B ''count'':117B ''counter-offensiv'':116B ''crisis'':2A,5B,35B,211B ''cult'':76B ''cyrodiil'':99B,149B ''daedr'':61B,121B ''daedric'':18B,180B ''dagon'':22B,80B,204B ''dawn'':73B ''defenseless'':151B ''despit'':131B ''destiny'':176B ''destroy'':102B ''devastation'':84B ''devot'':77B ''emerg'':62B,164B ''emperor'':42B ''empir'':135B ''ending'':209B ''fac'':93B ''facilitat'':69B ''fanatical'':75B ''figur'':168B ''forc'':142B,171B ''forcing'':122B ''from'':144B ''gat'':55B,67B,127B ''great'':10B ''heir'':159B ''heirs'':48B ''her'':174B ''his'':47B ''hist'':112B ''hord'':19B ''ignit'':37B ''in'':29B,63B,82B,98B,128B,182B ''into'':188B ''join'':170B ''key'':88B ''kings'':200B ''known'':7B ''kvatch'':97B ''largely'':150B ''last'':158B ''leading'':49B ''leaving'':148B ''lik'':146B ''maintain'':138B ''marking'':213B ''marsh'':107B ''martin'':155B,186B ''mehrun'':21B,79B,203B ''morrowind'':147B ''mount'':113B ''mythic'':72B ''numbers'':65B ''oblivion'':1A,4B,54B,207B ''of'':20B,26B,41B,53B,105B,160B,175B,191B,196B,199B,216B ''offensiv'':118B ''opening'':52B ''order'':139B ''overwhelming'':64B ''peopl'':25B ''pivotal'':167B ''pow'':195B ''provinc'':87B,145B ''region'':130B ''regions'':89B ''resulting'':81B ''sacrific'':185B ''septim'':44B,156B,162B ''sieg'':95B ''significant'':141B ''skyrim'':92B ''struggl'':136B ''successful'':115B ''such'':90B ''tamriel'':27B ''that'':129B ''the'':3B,9B,17B,24B,30B,34B,39B,51B,57B,71B,103B,111B,120B,126B,132B,134B,157B,161B,179B,194B,197B,210B,214B,217B ''them'':123B ''thes'':66B ''third'':218B ''this'':153B ''threat'':181B ''through'':59B ''throughout'':85B ''thus'':208B ''to'':50B,78B,124B,137B,177B,201B,206B ''transform'':187B ''turmoil'':133B ''upon'':109B ''uriel'':43B ''utilizing'':193B ''various'':86B ''vii'':45B ''was'':12B,36B,100B ''wer'':68B ''which'':60B ''whil'':96B ''widespr'':83B ''with'':140B,172B ''withdrawn'':143B ''year'':31B', 'scholar, daedra, daedric', '

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('morag_tong', 'The Morag Tong, or "Foresters Guild" in Dark Elvish, is an ancient guild of assassins based in Morrowind, operating under the patronage of the Daedric Prince Mephala. Founded in the First Era, the Morag Tong gained prominence as a means to settle disputes within Morrowind''s Great Houses, preventing open warfare through sanctioned killings known as Honorable Writs of Execution. These writs allowed assassins to carry out legal executions with complete immunity, cementing their role in Dunmeri politics. Despite their lawful standing in Morrowind, their methods and allegiance to Mephala stirred controversy. Some legends suggest the guild originally worshipped Sithis and even influenced the formation of the Dark Brotherhood, a splinter group that rose to prominence outside of Morrowind. Over centuries, the Morag Tong oscillated between shadowy obscurity and political power, adapting to the changing tides of history.

The guild''s practices reflect Mephala''s principles of subtlety and precision, with their assassins employing shortblades, light armor, and archery as their tools of choice. Their deadly arsenal is meticulously crafted, blending functionality with intimidating designs that evoke chitinous creatures. The Morag Tong''s influence waned during periods of upheaval, such as after the assassination of the Akaviri Potentate Versidue-Shaie, but they resurfaced in times of need, maintaining their ancient role as arbiters of Dunmeri vendettas.

Historically, Orcs were feared and regarded as savage barbarians by other races of Tamriel, but over time they have won respect, particularly for their martial prowess and skilled craftsmanship. Their armorers are among the best in Tamriel, and their warriors, known for their berserker rage, are highly valued in Imperial Legions.

Revering nature and often associating with Daedric Princes like Hircine, the Wyrd enforces laws of nature known only to them, frequently leaning into its darker aspects. Their members, while primarily human, sometimes include beastfolk like hagravens and lamias, who often hold leadership roles. These covens are known for their unique practices, such as curing lycanthropy and vampirism, and their ability to transform into animals, including wolves and ravens. Historically linked to the Druids of Galen, the Glenmoril Wyrd broke away due to differing philosophies, choosing to live as reclusive protectors of the wilds. They see themselves as part of nature itself, drawing their power from the land and maintaining a delicate balance between life and death.

The covens are spread across regions such as High Rock, Skyrim, and Bangkorai, each with distinct beliefs and practices. While many covens venerate Hircine, others align with Daedric Princes like Namira or Molag Bal, creating both alliances and rivalries with groups like the Reachmen. The Glenmoril Wyrd has been influential in major events throughout history, such as assisting in the Bloodmoon Prophecy on Solstheim and making a pact with the Companions of Whiterun that introduced lycanthropy into their ranks. Over time, some covens have dwindled, such as the hagraven-led Glenmoril witches in Falkreath Hold, who became the last of their kind in Skyrim by the Fourth Era.

It was triggered by the death of King Lysandus of Daggerfall, leading to an upheaval in the regions of Hammerfell and High Rock. This phenomenon is often likened to a Dragon Break, reminiscent of the Middle Dawn from the First Era, although its effects were localized to the Iliac Bay.

Central to the Warp was the Totem of Tiber Septim, an ancient artifact that allowed its wielder to control the colossal war machine known as Numidium. An unknown hero, believed to be an agent of the Blades, acquired the Totem, igniting a fierce competition among various factions, including Sentinel, Wayrest, Daggerfall, and Orsinium, all vying for its power.

This period is characterized by the power struggles and fragmentation of Tamriel''s kingdoms, alongside the emergence of notable organizations such as the Mages Guild and the Dark Brotherhood.

Throughout the Second Era, various events shaped the political landscape, including the establishment of the Elsweyr Confederacy in 2E 309 and the founding of the Mages Guild in 2E 230. The assassination of Versidue-Shaie in 2E 324 marked a turning point, leading to the dissolution of the Second Empire and the fragmentation of Imperial authority.

A notable conflict during this era was Varen''s Rebellion in 2E 576, sparked by Emperor Leovic''s controversial legalization of Daedra worship. Varen Aquilarios, the leader of the rebellion, eventually took the throne but was lost in the chaos of the Soulburst in 2E 578, an event that unleashed Daedric forces upon Nirn.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('second_era', 'The Second Era of Tamriel, often referred to as the Common Era (CE), is a period marked by significant political upheaval, the decline of the Second Empire, and the rise of powerful factions and alliances. The era began in 2E 1 with the official assumption of stewardship by Potentate Versidue-Shaie, following the fall of the Reman Dynasty. This period is characterized by the power struggles and fragmentation of Tamriel''s kingdoms, alongside the emergence of notable organizations such as the Mages Guild and the Dark Brotherhood.

Throughout the Second Era, various events shaped the political landscape, including the establishment of the Elsweyr Confederacy in 2E 309 and the founding of the Mages Guild in 2E 230. The assassination of Versidue-Shaie in 2E 324 marked a turning point, leading to the dissolution of the Second Empire and the fragmentation of Imperial authority.

A notable conflict during this era was Varen''s Rebellion in 2E 576, sparked by Emperor Leovic''s controversial legalization of Daedra worship. Varen Aquilarios, the leader of the rebellion, eventually took the throne but was lost in the chaos of the Soulburst in 2E 578, an event that unleashed Daedric forces upon Nirn.

The Second Era also saw the formation of the Aldmeri Dominion, the Ebonheart Pact, and the Daggerfall Covenant, which clashed in the Three Banners War for control of the Ruby Throne. The era concluded with Tiber Septim''s unification of Tamriel in 2E 896, marking the rise of the Third Empire and the end of the Second Era.

However, their success led to personal pride and internal conflict. In 3E 121, the order fractured during the War of the Red Diamond when Sir Berich stole relics, leading to a deadly confrontation with Sir Caius. Many knights left to join the war, and the order gradually dissolved, with only a few knights continuing quests for the remaining relics.

The order''s decline continued with individual knights meeting tragic fates. Sir Ralvas failed to claim the Mace of the Crusader, while Sir Juncan died shortly after discovering the Boots'' location. Sir Torolf and Sir Gregory perished in the War, and Sir Henrik hid the Shield of the Crusader before dying in defense of it. Sir Casimir''s arrogance led to his downfall when he killed a beggar in the Chapel of Stendarr, resulting in a curse and his eventual death. By 3E 131, the Knights of the Nine were officially disbanded, and Sir Berich became a political figure with resentment towards the order.

Revering nature and often associating with Daedric Princes like Hircine, the Wyrd enforces laws of nature known only to them, frequently leaning into its darker aspects. Their members, while primarily human, sometimes include beastfolk like hagravens and lamias, who often hold leadership roles. These covens are known for their unique practices, such as curing lycanthropy and vampirism, and their ability to transform into animals, including wolves and ravens. Historically linked to the Druids of Galen, the Glenmoril Wyrd broke away due to differing philosophies, choosing to live as reclusive protectors of the wilds. They see themselves as part of nature itself, drawing their power from the land and maintaining a delicate balance between life and death.

The covens are spread across regions such as High Rock, Skyrim, and Bangkorai, each with distinct beliefs and practices. While many covens venerate Hircine, others align with Daedric Princes like Namira or Molag Bal, creating both alliances and rivalries with groups like the Reachmen. The Glenmoril Wyrd has been influential in major events throughout history, such as assisting in the Bloodmoon Prophecy on Solstheim and making a pact with the Companions of Whiterun that introduced lycanthropy into their ranks. Over time, some covens have dwindled, such as the hagraven-led Glenmoril witches in Falkreath Hold, who became the last of their kind in Skyrim by the Fourth Era.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('great_war', 'The Great War, also known as the First War Against the Empire by the Thalmor, was a significant conflict that occurred from 4E 171 to 175 between the Third Empire and the Third Aldmeri Dominion. The war began with a Thalmor invasion of Imperial territory, motivated by the desire to assert dominance following the destabilization of Summerset after the Oblivion Crisis. The Thalmor seized control of the Summerset Isles in 4E 22 and later annexed Valenwood and Elsweyr, further consolidating their power.

The conflict escalated after the Thalmor demanded tributes, territorial concessions, and the disbandment of the Blades, along with a ban on the worship of Talos.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('dragon_cult', 'The Dragon Cult, also known as the Atmoran Dragon Cult or Cult of the Dragon Priests, originated as a sect within the animal worship traditions brought by Atmorans to Tamriel. Initially, this sect revered dragons as divine beings, particularly associating their worship with Akatosh, the chief deity among the Divines. As a result, dragons held a position of supremacy over mankind, with dragon priests serving as their powerful intermediaries, enforcing laws and maintaining order in society. Temples were erected to honor these dragons, many of which remain as draugr-infested ruins today.

However, over time, the Dragon Cult became increasingly oppressive, establishing their capital at Bromjunaar in what is now Hjaalmarch and effectively enslaving the Nordic populace. This shift in demeanor is believed to have been influenced by Alduin, the First-Born of Akatosh, who sought to dominate Mundus. The ensuing discontent led to the ancient Dragon War, in which humans, aided by some dragons, eventually triumphed over Alduin and his cult. The dragon priests were overthrown, and the dragons were driven into hiding. Despite their fall, the Dragon Cult adapted, preserving the practice of constructing dragon mounds for the remains of fallen dragons, as they awaited the day of their return. By the First Era, the arrival of the priests of the Eight Divines further diminished the cult''s influence, leading to its eventual extinction, with the last holdouts perishing in mass suicide at Forelhost in 1E 140.', '''140'':243B ''1e'':242B ''adapt'':185B ''aid'':156B ''akatosh'':46B,138B ''alduin'':132B,163B ''also'':6B ''among'':50B ''ancient'':150B ''and'':74B,115B,164B,172B ''animal'':25B ''arrival'':212B ''as'':8B,20B,38B,53B,68B,90B,199B ''associating'':42B ''at'':108B,239B ''atmor'':10B ''atmorans'':30B ''await'':201B ''becam'':102B ''been'':129B ''beings'':40B ''believ'':126B ''born'':136B ''bromjun'':109B ''brought'':28B ''by'':29B,131B,157B,207B ''capital'':107B ''chief'':48B ''constructing'':190B ''cult'':2A,5B,12B,14B,101B,166B,184B,223B ''day'':203B ''deity'':49B ''demeanor'':124B ''despit'':179B ''diminish'':221B ''discontent'':146B ''divin'':39B,52B,219B ''dominat'':142B ''dragon'':1A,4B,11B,17B,65B,100B,151B,168B,183B,191B ''dragons'':37B,56B,85B,159B,174B,198B ''draugr'':92B ''draugr-infest'':91B ''driv'':176B ''effectively'':116B ''eight'':218B ''enforcing'':72B ''enslaving'':117B ''ensuing'':145B ''erect'':81B ''establishing'':105B ''eventual'':229B ''eventually'':160B ''extinction'':230B ''fall'':181B,197B ''first'':135B,209B ''first-born'':134B ''for'':193B ''forelhost'':240B ''furth'':220B ''hav'':128B ''held'':57B ''hiding'':178B ''his'':165B ''hjaalmarch'':114B ''holdouts'':234B ''honor'':83B ''howev'':96B ''humans'':155B ''in'':77B,110B,123B,153B,236B,241B ''increasingly'':103B ''infest'':93B ''influenc'':130B,225B ''initially'':33B ''intermediari'':71B ''into'':177B ''is'':112B,125B ''its'':228B ''known'':7B ''last'':233B ''laws'':73B ''leading'':226B ''led'':147B ''maintaining'':75B ''mankind'':63B ''many'':86B ''mass'':237B ''mounds'':192B ''mundus'':143B ''nordic'':119B ''now'':113B ''of'':15B,60B,87B,137B,189B,196B,204B,213B,216B ''oppressiv'':104B ''or'':13B ''order'':76B ''originat'':19B ''over'':62B,97B,162B ''overthrown'':171B ''particularly'':41B ''perishing'':235B ''populac'':120B ''position'':59B ''powerful'':70B ''practic'':188B ''preserving'':186B ''priests'':18B,66B,169B,215B ''remain'':89B ''remains'':195B ''result'':55B ''return'':206B ''rever'':36B ''ruins'':94B ''s'':224B ''sect'':22B,35B ''serving'':67B ''shift'':122B ''society'':78B ''som'':158B ''sought'':140B ''suicid'':238B ''supremacy'':61B ''tamriel'':32B ''templ'':79B ''the'':3B,9B,16B,24B,43B,47B,51B,69B,99B,106B,118B,133B,144B,149B,167B,173B,180B,182B,187B,194B,202B,205B,208B,211B,214B,217B,222B,232B ''thes'':84B ''they'':200B ''this'':34B,121B ''tim'':98B ''to'':31B,82B,127B,141B,148B,227B ''today'':95B ''traditions'':27B ''triumph'':161B ''war'':152B ''wer'':80B,170B,175B ''what'':111B ''which'':88B,154B ''who'':139B ''with'':45B,64B,231B ''within'':23B ''worship'':26B,44B', 'scholar, dragon, miraakcult', '

Often referred to as "people of the root," Argonians share a profound bond with the Hist, symbolized through rituals involving the consumption of their sap, which grants visions and strengthens this connection. The Hist are believed to predate all mortal races, surviving the catastrophic wars of the Ehlnofey. Their collective consciousness spans across Nirn, allowing them to act as one entity, though rogue Hist, like the one in Lilmoth, occasionally sever this bond. The Hist are pivotal to Argonian life, nurturing their eggs during hatching rituals and guiding their culture through mystical communion, dreams, and visions. Marsh-born Argonians wield Hist-specific magic and are deeply tied to their roots, whereas those hatched outside Black Marsh, known as lukiul, often struggle to hear the Hist''s voice.

Legends surrounding the Hist highlight their role in major historical events, such as the Oblivion Crisis, where they rallied Argonians to invade Mehrunes Dagon''s realms, leading to a decisive victory. The Hist are also known for their strange artifacts and manifestations, such as the Dreaming Tree, which preserved the souls of an Argonian tribe during an Ayleid invasion, and the Sleeping Tree in Skyrim, speculated to be a "cousin" of the Hist from Oblivion. Hist sap, a potent and mystical substance, is capable of altering living beings, enhancing combat abilities, and even creating dangerous bloodlust when consumed improperly.

As one of Tamriel''s oldest criminal organizations, the Tong has operated since at least the Second Era, engaging in smuggling, extortion, slavery, and murder, often targeting outlanders to protect what they see as Dunmeri sovereignty. Members of the Tong take pride in their dark history, promoting a vision of Morrowind where outsiders are either enslaved or expelled. Despite their xenophobic ideology, the Tong occasionally collaborates with foreigners when profit outweighs prejudice. Throughout its history, the Camonna Tong has clashed with abolitionist groups, Great Houses, and rival factions like the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild while maintaining its power in Morrowind’s criminal underworld.

By the Third Era, the Camonna Tong wielded significant influence through its alliance with House Hlaalu, operating openly in towns like Balmora, Hla Oad, and Vivec City.

The Camonna Tong is a notorious Dunmer criminal syndicate in Morrowind, known for its opposition to foreign influence and involvement in activities like smuggling, extortion, slavery, and murder. Active since at least the Second Era, the Tong promotes Dunmeri sovereignty, often targeting outsiders, though it sometimes collaborates with them for profit. By the Third Era, the Tong gained significant influence through its alliance with House Hlaalu, manipulating politics and secretly working with the Sixth House during the Nerevarine prophecy. The Tong''s power diminished after the Nerevarine''s actions and the Oblivion Crisis, with its future uncertain following Morrowind''s devastation. Despite this, the Camonna Tong remains a symbol of Dunmeri xenophobia and criminal enterprise.', '', '', 'lore');

Comprised mainly of Argonians and Khajiit, the Company originated from soldiers who had failed to reclaim Black Marsh for the Empire. They set up operations in Leyawiin and the surrounding Blackwood Forest, naming themselves after the region and Khajiiti lore of "black charcoal warriors." Unlike the Fighters Guild, the Blackwood Company had no ethical constraints, taking on morally dubious contracts and accepting recruits without regard for criminal records or reputation. Their willingness to undercut competitors and employ reckless methods led to significant tensions with the Fighters Guild, culminating in a dangerous rivalry that nearly dismantled the Guild.

The Company’s rise to power was tied to their use of Hist sap, extracted from a sick Hist tree smuggled out of Black Marsh. This sap granted their members increased combat prowess but caused dangerous hallucinogenic bloodlust in non-Argonians. The Hero of Kvatch, infiltrating the Company on behalf of the Fighters Guild, uncovered this secret after being drugged and manipulated into slaughtering innocent townsfolk at Water’s Edge, believing them to be goblins. The Hero later destroyed the Hist tree and its extraction mechanism, killing the remaining Blackwood Company members in the process.

The Maormer, or Sea Elves, are an elusive race of Mer native to the mist-covered island of Pyandonea, south of the Summerset Isles. With pearlescent white to blue skin, fin-like ears, and sometimes gills, they are adapted to life at sea. Led by the immortal King Orgnum, a sorcerer who grows younger with age, the Maormer seek to conquer the Summerset Isles, driven by their hatred for the Altmer. Masters of snake magic and storm magic, they use sea serpents and elemental powers in naval warfare. Though their ambitions have lessened, their enmity toward the Altmer and mysterious homeland make them a persistent threat on the seas of Tamriel.', '', '', 'lore');

However, this balance of power shifted as the dragon priests grew tyrannical, enslaving the population and demanding absolute obedience.

Initially, humanity suffered immense losses, but the tide shifted when certain dragons sided with men. It is said that from these traitorous dragons, men learned powerful magics, possibly with the intervention of Akatosh, allowing them to combat their former overlords. Over time, the dragon priests were overthrown, and dragons were hunted to near extinction.

Led by the Slave-Queen Alessia, the rebellion marked the liberation of the Nedic people from their Ayleid overlords, who had dominated Cyrodiil through a brutal regime of Daedra worship, enslavement, and ritual cruelty. With divine guidance from the Eight Divines and the aid of key allies like Pelinal Whitestrake and Morihaus, Alessia united human slaves and sympathetic Ayleid factions in a desperate uprising. The rebellion culminated in the Siege of White-Gold Tower, where Pelinal slew the demigod Umaril the Unfeathered but fell in battle. This victory dismantled the Ayleid Empire and laid the foundation for the Alessian Empire, ushering in the dominance of men over mer in Cyrodiil.

The rebellion not only freed the Nedic slaves but also began the Ayleids'' gradual decline. Many Daedra-worshipping Ayleids fled to Valenwood and High Rock, while their remaining city-states either integrated into the new Empire as vassals or were annihilated by the Alessian forces. The rebellion’s aftermath saw Alessia crowned as the first Empress of Cyrodiil, the establishment of the Amulet of Kings to protect Mundus from Oblivion, and the rise of the Imperial Pantheon, blending elements of Nordic and Elven faiths.

One such tale details a contest between Sheogorath and Hircine, where each was to groom a beast for battle. While Hircine bred a monstrous Daedroth imbued with lycanthropy, Sheogorath introduced a tiny, colorful bird. Despite its size, the bird''s antics drove the Daedroth into a self-destructive frenzy, humiliating Hircine. Another account describes a wager between Sheogorath and Vaermina, testing their influence over a mortal bard, Darius Shano. Vaermina subjected the bard to horrific dreams that fueled his notoriety, while Sheogorath withdrew her presence, letting bitterness and madness consume him. Ultimately, Sheogorath claimed Darius''s soul, demonstrating the intricate interplay of madness and creation.

In another tale, Sheogorath''s manipulations involve the Orc champion Emmeg Gro-Kayra, who receives a cursed blade, Neb-Crescen, from a mysterious figure. The blade drives Emmeg to commit an unspeakable act, killing another Orc in a frenzied state. This crime draws Malacath, who, seeking vengeance, unknowingly slays his own son. Sheogorath appears to claim the fallen champion''s severed head and weapon, leaving Malacath in despair.

Anu and Padomay clashed over Nir, leading to her death and the shattering of the twelve worlds of Creation. In the aftermath, Anu reformed the remnants into Nirn, only to be mortally wounded by Padomay, and both were cast outside Time. Their mingled blood gave rise to the Aedra, while Padomay’s blood formed the Daedra, and Anu’s blood became the stars.

The myth continues with the descendants of Creation’s survivors, the Ehlnofey and Hist, who shaped the world through war and migration. The Old Ehlnofey became the ancestors of Mer, giving rise to elves like the Altmer, Bosmer, and Dunmer in Tamriel, while the Wandering Ehlnofey spread across other continents to become Men, such as the Nords and Redguards. The great Ehlnofey war reshaped Nirn, forming its continents and oceans, while the Hist were largely destroyed, surviving only in Black Marsh.

Following a dismissal from his stable position at the Atrius Building Commission, Scotti receives an ill-fated invitation from a former colleague, Liodes Jurus, to exploit post-war rebuilding opportunities in Valenwood. Through a series of increasingly perilous events—including encounters with mercenaries, natural disasters, predatory wildlife, and betrayals—Scotti stumbles his way through the Bosmer province, eventually landing an audience with the enigmatic Silvenar, the spiritual leader of Valenwood. The text explores themes of survival, greed, cultural misunderstanding, and the absurdity of imperial ambitions in a foreign land.

The book, divided into seven parts, combines a satirical critique of imperial bureaucracy with an adventurous narrative rich in cultural detail. Scotti’s journey mirrors the chaotic nature of Valenwood itself, with its dense jungles, mystical traditions, and ongoing conflicts with neighboring territories like Elsweyr and Summerset Isle. Despite his lack of skill or heroism, Scotti’s inadvertent cunning allows him to secure contracts that benefit himself and the Imperial Building Commission, albeit at the cost of moral compromise. The story also highlights the absurdities of colonialism, as outsiders profit from a war-torn province’s misfortunes while failing to understand or respect its people. Ultimately, Scotti returns to the Imperial City, only to find that his success comes with eerie consequences, leaving readers to ponder the price of ambition and the dissonance between civilized ideals and the savage reality of conquest.', '''absurditi'':218B ''absurdity'':126B ''adventurous'':149B ''albeit'':206B ''allows'':193B ''also'':215B ''ambition'':264B ''ambitions'':129B ''an'':57B,104B,148B ''and'':38B,92B,124B,171B,179B,201B,265B,271B ''as'':32B,221B ''at'':50B,207B ''atrius'':52B ''audienc'':105B ''benefit'':199B ''betrayals'':93B ''betw'':268B ''book'':135B ''bosm'':100B ''building'':53B,204B ''bureaucracy'':146B ''by'':10B ''cha'':37B ''chaotic'':160B ''chapt'':17B ''chronicling'':19B ''city'':31B,246B ''civiliz'':269B ''clerk'':27B ''colleag'':65B ''colonialism'':220B ''com'':253B ''combin'':140B ''commission'':54B,205B ''compilation'':18B ''compromis'':212B ''conflicts'':173B ''conquest'':276B ''consequenc'':256B ''contracts'':197B ''cost'':209B ''critiqu'':143B ''cultural'':122B,153B ''cunning'':192B ''danc'':2A,6B ''dangers'':40B ''decumus'':23B ''dens'':167B ''despit'':182B ''detail'':154B ''disasters'':89B ''dismissal'':45B ''dissonanc'':267B ''divid'':136B ''eeri'':255B ''elsweyr'':178B ''encounters'':85B ''enigmatic'':108B ''events'':83B ''eventually'':102B ''exploit'':69B ''explor'':117B ''failing'':233B ''fat'':60B ''find'':249B ''fir'':4A,8B ''following'':43B ''foreign'':132B ''form'':64B ''from'':28B,46B,62B,224B ''gre'':121B ''heroism'':188B ''highlights'':216B ''him'':194B ''himself'':200B ''his'':47B,96B,183B,251B ''ideals'':270B ''ill'':59B ''ill-fat'':58B ''imperial'':30B,128B,145B,203B,245B ''in'':3A,7B,75B,130B,152B ''inadvertent'':191B ''including'':84B ''increasingly'':81B ''into'':137B ''invitation'':61B ''is'':13B ''isle'':181B ''its'':166B,238B ''itself'':164B ''jarth'':12B ''journey'':157B ''jungl'':168B ''jurus'':67B ''lack'':184B ''land'':133B ''landing'':103B ''lead'':112B ''leaving'':257B ''lik'':177B ''liod'':66B ''mercenari'':87B ''middling'':26B ''mirrors'':158B ''misadventur'':21B ''misfortun'':231B ''misunderstanding'':123B ''moral'':211B ''mystical'':169B ''narrativ'':150B ''natur'':161B ''natural'':88B ''navigat'':34B ''neighboring'':175B ''of'':22B,41B,80B,113B,119B,127B,144B,162B,185B,210B,219B,263B,275B ''ongoing'':172B ''only'':247B ''opportuniti'':74B ''or'':187B,236B ''outsiders'':222B ''parts'':139B ''peopl'':239B ''perilous'':82B ''political'':36B ''pond'':260B ''position'':49B ''post'':71B ''post-w'':70B ''predatory'':90B ''pric'':262B ''profit'':223B ''provinc'':101B,229B ''readers'':258B ''reality'':274B ''rebuilding'':73B ''receiv'':56B ''respect'':237B ''returns'':242B ''rich'':151B ''s'':156B,190B,230B ''satirical'':142B ''savag'':273B ''scotti'':24B,55B,94B,155B,189B,241B ''secur'':196B ''seri'':79B ''sev'':16B,138B ''seven-chapt'':15B ''silven'':109B ''skill'':186B ''spiritual'':111B ''stabl'':48B ''story'':214B ''stumbl'':95B ''success'':252B ''summerset'':180B ''survival'':120B ''territori'':176B ''text'':116B ''that'':198B,250B ''the'':20B,29B,35B,51B,99B,107B,110B,115B,125B,134B,159B,202B,208B,213B,217B,244B,261B,266B,272B ''them'':118B ''through'':77B,98B ''to'':68B,195B,234B,243B,248B,259B ''torn'':228B ''traditions'':170B ''ultimately'':240B ''understand'':235B ''valenwood'':42B,76B,114B,163B ''war'':72B,227B ''war-torn'':226B ''waughin'':11B ''way'':97B ''whil'':232B ''wild'':39B ''wildlif'':91B ''with'':86B,106B,147B,165B,174B,254B ''writt'':9B', 'scholar', '

He negotiated the Coldharbour Compact with eight Daedric Princes, believed to limit their direct involvement in mortal affairs, although this agreement was not always upheld. His craftsmanship yielded numerous artifacts and advanced metallic prosthetics, which could replace lost limbs, reflecting his belief that "the truth of clockwork is for all." However, his followers took great care to protect his inventions from misuse. With the advent of the New Temple in the Fourth Era, Sotha Sil, along with the other members of the Tribunal, was reclassified as a saint, while the worship of the Good Daedra was restored as central to Dunmeri faith.', '''advanc'':155B ''advent'':188B ''affairs'':141B ''agreement'':144B ''all'':173B ''allow'':73B ''almalexi'':76B ''along'':199B ''also'':5B ''although'':142B ''always'':147B ''and'':18B,35B,52B,75B,107B,154B ''apostl'':105B ''artifacts'':153B ''as'':7B,209B,221B ''belief'':165B ''believ'':133B ''beyond'':120B ''but'':72B ''by'':29B ''car'':179B ''central'':222B ''city'':101B ''clockwork'':54B,100B,104B,170B ''coldharbour'':127B ''compact'':128B ''consid'':68B ''could'':159B ''counterparts'':63B ''craftsmanship'':150B ''creation'':94B ''creations'':123B ''daedr'':218B ''daedric'':131B ''dedicating'':90B ''did'':66B ''direct'':137B ''divin'':80B ''dunm'':17B ''dunmeri'':224B ''eight'':130B ''embrac'':78B ''enigmatic'':23B ''ever'':46B ''ever-wound'':45B ''extend'':119B ''faith'':225B ''famously'':83B ''fath'':49B ''figur'':24B ''followers'':31B,176B ''for'':32B,111B,172B ''fourth'':195B ''fre'':88B ''from'':184B ''god'':14B,71B ''good'':217B ''great'':178B ''greatest'':97B ''held'':39B ''himself'':69B,91B ''his'':30B,33B,62B,96B,103B,121B,149B,164B,175B,182B ''howev'':174B ''identiti'':81B ''in'':59B,139B,193B ''including'':42B ''invention'':98B ''inventions'':183B ''involvement'':138B ''is'':171B ''king'':55B ''known'':6B ''legacy'':118B ''limbs'':162B ''limit'':135B ''lost'':161B ''magical'':36B ''mainspring'':44B ''many'':40B ''mechanical'':122B ''members'':203B ''metallic'':156B ''misus'':185B ''mortal'':140B ''most'':22B ''mysteri'':51B ''mystic'':13B ''negotiat'':125B ''new'':113B,191B ''nirn'':114B ''not'':67B,146B ''notion'':86B ''numerous'':152B ''of'':15B,20B,25B,50B,56B,87B,95B,169B,189B,204B,215B ''one'':19B,60B ''other'':202B ''princ'':132B ''prosthetics'':157B ''protect'':181B ''prowess'':37B ''pursu'':108B ''reclassifi'':208B ''reflecting'':163B ''reject'':84B ''replac'':160B ''resid'':106B ''restor'':220B ''rever'':28B ''s'':117B ''saint'':211B ''seht'':8B ''sil'':2A,4B,65B,116B,198B ''soth'':1A,3B,64B,115B,197B ''templ'':192B ''that'':166B ''the'':10B,16B,21B,26B,43B,48B,53B,57B,79B,85B,93B,99B,126B,136B,167B,187B,190B,194B,201B,205B,213B,216B ''this'':143B ''thre'':58B ''titl'':41B ''to'':77B,92B,134B,180B,223B ''took'':177B ''tribunal'':27B,206B ''truth'':168B ''unlik'':61B ''upheld'':148B ''vision'':110B ''vivec'':74B ''was'':9B,145B,207B,219B ''wher'':102B ''which'':158B ''whil'':212B ''will'':89B ''wisdom'':34B ''with'':129B,186B,200B ''wizard'':12B ''wizard-mystic'':11B ''worship'':214B ''wound'':47B ''yield'':151B', 'darkelf, daedra, daedric, scholar', 'Sotha Sil, also known as Seht, was the wizard-mystic god of the Dunmer and one of the Tribunal''s most enigmatic figures.

The main characters—a High Elf battlemage (Malvasian), a Dark Elf battlemage (Inzoliah), a Cyrodiil healer (Dolcettus), and an Argonian barbarian (Schiavas)—succumb to paranoia and betrayal as they navigate the perilous forest. The play masterfully blends tension, irony, and wit, showcasing the characters’ moral ambiguities and self-serving motivations. The narrative crescendos with a double-cross where scheming battlemages eliminate one another in pursuit of power, ending with Inzoliah’s ruthless triumph.

Thematically, the play explores trust, ambition, and the seductive allure of power, highlighting how alliances crumble under greed and suspicion. It cleverly critiques human (and mer) nature through its satirical portrayal of manipulative and self-serving characters, ultimately leading to their downfall. The epilogue reinforces the futility of treachery, as even the victor’s success is marred by unforeseen consequences.

The instructions detail constructing an effigy from human remains, encircling it with candles, and stabbing it with a Nightshade-coated dagger while reciting a specific incantation. The text''s macabre tone underscores the weight of summoning such dark forces and the blood-bound nature of the resulting contract.

Thematically, the book delves into the interplay of desperation, vengeance, and moral corruption.

A Minor Maze: Shalidor & Labyrinthian, written by an anonymous author, explores the history of Labyrinthian, a foreboding ruin with ties to Skyrim''s ancient Dragon Cult and later, the Archmage Shalidor. Originally built as a temple and evolving into the city of Bromjunaar, it was once the seat of the Dragon Cult''s power. Following the cult''s collapse, the site lay abandoned until Shalidor repurposed it as a rigorous testing ground for aspiring archmages. Labyrinthian''s mazes, designed to challenge both intellect and survival skills, embodied Shalidor''s philosophy of blending academic and practical mastery in the magical arts.

Thematically, the book reflects on the legacy of power, ambition, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. It contrasts the brutal rites of the Dragon Cult with the calculated trials of Shalidor, both of which left enduring marks on the ruins and their history. The site gained renewed fame in the Third Era as a pivotal location in the overthrow of Jagar Tharn during the Imperial Simulacrum.

The Adabal-a, written by Morihaus, is an ancient and revered text traditionally believed to be the memoirs of Morihaus, the winged-bull demigod and consort of Alessia, the Slave Queen. It recounts pivotal moments in early Cyrodiilic history, including Pelinal Whitestrake''s final words before his death, Alessia''s suffering and defiance during the Ayleid enslavement, and the origins of her many titles. The work paints a vivid picture of the brutal oppression under Ayleid rule and the resilience of Alessia as she rose to lead her people to freedom. Themes of divine intervention, mortal struggle, and the cost of liberation permeate the text, highlighting the blend of myth and history that defines Cyrodiilic lore.

This singular work also explores the mystical bond between Morihaus and Alessia, offering insight into her numerous names and their significance. Her transformation from a slave to the first Empress of Cyrodiil is framed as a divine journey, with Morihaus providing personal reflections on her courage and legacy.

Aedra and Daedra, written by an anonymous author, provides an accessible explanation of the fundamental differences between Aedra, Daedra, and their associations with gods and demons. The book clarifies that the terms "Aedra" and "Daedra" are precise in Elvish, with Aedra meaning "ancestor" and Daedra translating to "not our ancestors." This distinction is particularly important to the Dunmer, reflecting their ideological and mythical divide. Aedra are tied to stasis, creation, and the mortal world, bound to the Earth Bones and vulnerable to death, as illustrated by the fate of Lorkhan. In contrast, Daedra embody change and transformation, lacking the ability to create but possessing the power to influence and alter reality, and they can only be banished, not killed.

Thematically, the book explores concepts of permanence versus adaptability, creation versus influence, and the nature of divine authority in Tamriel.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('the_aetherium_wars', 'The Aetherium Wars, written by Taron Dreth, explores the collapse of the Dwemer city-states in Skyrim, proposing a groundbreaking theory that their downfall was not solely due to external conquest but internal strife over Aetherium, a rare and powerful crystal. Dreth describes how the discovery of Aetherium led to an alliance of four Dwemer cities, including Arkngthamz, to oversee its study and the construction of the legendary Aetherium Forge. The artifacts produced by the Forge were said to possess immense power, but the alliance quickly disintegrated into a bitter civil war over control of the Forge. This infighting left the Dwemer vulnerable, paving the way for their defeat by King Gellir''s forces. The Forge''s location remains unknown, shrouded in mystery alongside the Dwemer''s enigmatic fate.

The Story of Aevar Stone-Singer, written by an anonymous Skaal storyteller, recounts the myth of Aevar, a young and unassuming member of the Skaal, who restores the stolen Gifts of the All-Maker to his people. The tale follows Aevar''s journey as he retrieves essential elements of life—water, earth, beasts, trees, the sun, and winds—from the clutches of the malevolent Greedy Man, an embodiment of the Adversary. Guided by the All-Maker, Aevar overcomes trials that test his courage, resourcefulness, and perseverance, ultimately restoring balance and harmony to the Skaal''s world. His deeds highlight themes of humility, selflessness, and the power of determination in the face of overwhelming odds.

Thematically, the story emphasizes the Skaal’s belief in living in harmony with nature and the dangers of complacency. It also serves as a cautionary tale about greed and the disruption it causes. While framed as a singular tale, its cyclical nature reflects the Skaal''s cultural focus on preserving the balance between humanity and the natural world.

Known as the Lord of Revelry, Sanguine embodies excess in all forms, encouraging the pursuit of pleasure, lust, and wild abandon.

His sphere encompasses not only drunken revelry and wild orgies but also the darker aspects of human desire, such as perversion and excess. Sanguine''s influence is most evident in the Myriad Realms of Revelry, small chaotic realms dedicated to endless pleasure, where mortals often become trapped, lured by indulgence.

Despite his carefree demeanor, Sanguine''s worship can have dangerous consequences. His followers, ranging from party-goers to secret cults, revel in excess, sometimes to the point of destruction or death. Celebrations in his name can be found across Tamriel, from Khajiiti midnight rites to Imperial festivals, where indulgence in drink, dance, and flesh is seen as acts of devotion. His most famous artifact, the Sanguine Rose, allows its wielder to summon a Daedra to cause havoc.

Ahzidal''s Descent, written by Halund Greycloak, tells the tragic tale of Ahzidal, a gifted enchanter whose relentless pursuit of knowledge and vengeance led to his downfall. Born in Saarthal, Ahzidal left his home to study under elven masters, only to return years later to find his city in ruins, destroyed by the elves. Consumed by grief and anger, he vowed revenge and devoted himself to mastering the magical arts, learning from the Dwemer, Ayleids, Falmer, and others. His skills proved instrumental in helping Ysgramor and the Companions reclaim Saarthal, fulfilling his oath of vengeance against the elves. However, his insatiable hunger for power drove him further, delving into forbidden knowledge of Dragon Priests and the realms of Oblivion, which ultimately consumed him.

Thematically, the story warns against the dangers of obsession and the cost of unchecked ambition.

The text outlines the group’s philosophy and tactics, emphasizing their unorthodox approach to warfare and life. Themes of defiance, cultural identity, and survival are woven throughout. The Renrijra Krin advocate for bravery in the face of impossible odds, the necessity of strategic retreat, the importance of enjoying life despite struggle, and an unflinching willingness to kill and reclaim what was unjustly taken from them.

The book is structured around six core principles, expressed through Khajiiti proverbs, such as "It Is Good to Be Brave" and "We Justly Take by Force," blending humor, pragmatism, and righteous anger. It reflects the Khajiiti ethos of resilience and cunning, prioritizing the reclamation of their ancestral lands while fostering a deep connection to their community.

Alduin is Real, and He Ent Akatosh, written by Thromgar Iron-Head, is an impassioned, if poorly written, essay by a self-described "prowd Nord" seeking to clarify the distinction between Alduin, the World-Eater, and Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time. Thromgar''s argument hinges on cultural and moral differences: Akatosh is revered as a protective and benevolent deity across Tamriel, while Alduin is an evil, flesh-and-blood dragon intent on destruction. The essay draws from Nordic oral traditions and Imperial legends, such as the tale of Martin Septim, to emphasize the vast divide between these two figures.

Themes of cultural pride, skepticism toward Imperial perspectives, and the importance of oral tradition in preserving Nordic history are central to the work. Written in a single volume with intentional spelling errors reflecting Thromgar''s lack of formal education, the text serves as both a declaration of Nordic identity and a critique of the Imperial conflation of their gods with other cultures'' beliefs. Through humor and earnest conviction, it highlights the tension between Skyrim''s fiercely independent traditions and Imperial influence.', '''across'':67B ''akatosh'':10B,43B,58B ''alduin'':1A,4B,37B,70B ''an'':18B,72B ''and'':7B,42B,55B,64B,76B,89B,116B,157B,173B,186B ''are'':126B ''argument'':51B ''as'':61B,93B,150B ''beliefs'':170B ''benevolent'':65B ''betw'':36B,104B,180B ''blood'':77B ''both'':151B ''by'':12B,24B ''central'':127B ''clarify'':33B ''conflation'':163B ''conviction'':175B ''critiqu'':159B ''cultur'':169B ''cultural'':54B,110B ''declaration'':153B ''deity'':66B ''describ'':28B ''destruction'':81B ''differenc'':57B ''distinction'':35B ''divid'':103B ''dragon'':45B,78B ''draws'':84B ''earnest'':174B ''eat'':41B ''education'':146B ''emphasiz'':100B ''ent'':9B ''errors'':139B ''essay'':23B,83B ''evil'':73B ''fiercely'':183B ''figur'':107B ''flesh'':75B ''flesh-and-blood'':74B ''formal'':145B ''from'':85B ''god'':46B ''gods'':166B ''head'':16B ''highlights'':177B ''hing'':52B ''history'':125B ''humor'':172B ''identity'':156B ''if'':20B ''impassion'':19B ''imperial'':90B,114B,162B,187B ''importanc'':118B ''in'':122B,132B ''independent'':184B ''influenc'':188B ''intent'':79B ''intentional'':137B ''iron'':15B ''iron-h'':14B ''is'':2A,5B,17B,59B,71B ''it'':176B ''lack'':143B ''legends'':91B ''martin'':97B ''moral'':56B ''nord'':30B ''nordic'':86B,124B,155B ''of'':47B,96B,109B,119B,144B,154B,160B,164B ''on'':53B,80B ''oral'':87B,120B ''other'':168B ''perspectiv'':115B ''poorly'':21B ''preserving'':123B ''prid'':111B ''protectiv'':63B ''prowd'':29B ''real'':3A,6B ''reflecting'':140B ''rever'':60B ''s'':50B,142B,182B ''seeking'':31B ''self'':27B ''self-describ'':26B ''septim'':98B ''serv'':149B ''singl'':134B ''skepticism'':112B ''skyrim'':181B ''spelling'':138B ''such'':92B ''tal'':95B ''tamriel'':68B ''tension'':179B ''text'':148B ''the'':34B,38B,44B,82B,94B,101B,117B,129B,147B,161B,165B,178B ''them'':108B ''thes'':105B ''thromg'':13B,49B,141B ''through'':171B ''tim'':48B ''to'':32B,99B,128B ''toward'':113B ''tradition'':121B ''traditions'':88B,185B ''two'':106B ''vast'':102B ''volum'':135B ''whil'':69B ''with'':136B,167B ''work'':130B ''world'':40B ''world-eat'':39B ''writt'':11B,22B,131B', 'scholar', 'Alduin is Real, and He Ent Akatosh, you do not know the author of the book and have limited knowledge of it, is an essay by Thromgar Iron-Head, defending the distinction between the Nordic dragon god Alduin and Akatosh, emphasizing their cultural and moral differences.

The Alduin_Akatosh Dichotomy, written by Alexandre Simon, High Priest of the Akatosh Chantry in Wayrest, explores the theological debate surrounding the relationship between Akatosh, the Great Dragon and Divine, and Alduin, the "World-Eater" of Nord legend. Simon examines the perspectives of different cultures—particularly the Altmer and the Nords—on these figures. While the Altmer identify Auri-El as Akatosh colored by their cultural beliefs, Nords differentiate Akatosh as a benevolent Divine from Alduin, whom they depict as a destructive dragon, a harbinger of doom and enemy of mankind. Simon concludes that Nord legends, shaped by oral tradition, have misrepresented Akatosh, transforming him into the monstrous Alduin due to misunderstandings over time.

Themes of cultural interpretation, the reliability of oral history, and the pursuit of theological truth dominate the work. It is a single book that attempts to reconcile conflicting beliefs about these two figures, arguing that Alduin is a distorted version of Akatosh rather than a separate entity.

Sheogorath is the Daedric Prince of Madness, chaos, and creativity, known for his unpredictable and often cruel sense of humor. He rules the Shivering Isles, a plane of Oblivion divided into Mania and Dementia, reflecting the dual aspects of madness. Sheogorath is notorious for his bizarre, sadistic, and whimsical behavior, often treating mortals and even other Daedric Princes as his playthings. His appearance is usually that of a well-dressed, eccentric man wielding a cane, which contrasts sharply with his unpredictable and dangerous nature. Legends tell that Sheogorath was once Jyggalag, the Daedric Prince of Order, but was cursed by the other Daedric Princes to embody the chaos he once despised. This curse led to the recurring Greymarch, during which Jyggalag would briefly reclaim his form before reverting back to Sheogorath.

Sheogorath is revered and feared in many cultures, especially among the Khajiit, who call him the Skooma Cat, and the Dunmer, who regard him as one of the Four Corners of the House of Troubles.

These undead warriors perform daily acts of homage and even transfer life energy to sustain their masters for eternity.

Ancestors and the Dunmer, written by an anonymous scholar, is a guide for outsiders seeking to understand the ancestor veneration and spirit magic practiced by the Dunmer of Morrowind. The text explores the sacred bond between the Dunmer and their ancestors, maintained through rituals at family shrines called Waiting Doors and fortified by ghost fences constructed from ancestral remains. These practices emphasize the importance of familial duty and the spiritual protection ancestors provide to their descendants. However, spirits bound against their will may become "mad ghosts," used as guardians or manipulated for rituals. The book highlights how the Dunmer view Oblivion as interconnected with the mortal world, unlike the dualistic perspective of humans, and how foreign views often misinterpret ancestor worship as necromancy.

Thematically, the book delves into reverence, familial loyalty, and the clash of cultural perceptions, particularly regarding necromancy, which the Dunmer abhor outside their sacred traditions. The text also touches on the Empire’s policy of tolerance and the adaptation of ancestral practices in the wake of changes like the construction of the Great Ghostfence.

The Anticipations, written by Anonymous, provides an overview of the relationship between the Tribunal, the Daedra, and the ancient worship practices of the Dunmer. The text explains how the Chimer once worshiped Daedra but abandoned them after the apotheosis of the Tribunal (Almalexia, Vivec, and Sotha Sil), who became the Dunmer’s divine protectors. The Three Good Daedra—Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala—acknowledged the Tribunal''s divinity and were integrated as "Anticipations" of the Tribunal. Meanwhile, the Rebel Daedra—Molag Bal, Malacath, Sheogorath, and Mehrunes Dagon—refused submission and became known as the Four Corners of the House of Troubles, symbolizing chaos and heresy.

Thematically, the book explores devotion, divine hierarchy, and the transformation of religious belief. It delves into the roles of the Three Good Daedra: Boethiah as the Anticipation of Almalexia, teaching enlightenment and victory over enemies; Mephala as the Anticipation of Vivec, guiding secretive and strategic survival; and Azura as the Anticipation of Sotha Sil, embodying magic, prophecy, and cultural identity.

Vaermina feeds on the memories and fears of mortals, often leaving them scarred with visions of despair and hopelessness. While she delights in the corruption of the mortal mind, she is also the giver of dark portents and destructive prophecies.

Vaermina is worshiped by cults who perform blood sacrifices and use dark magic to gain her favor or summon her minions. Her followers often partake in rituals involving sleep or nightmares, and some cults use her alchemical creation, Vaermina’s Torpor, to enter a dream-state known as the Dreamstride, allowing the user to traverse great distances within the dream world. Vaermina’s most notable artifact is the Skull of Corruption, a staff that creates dark duplicates of its victims, feeding on their memories. Despite her malevolent nature, Vaermina is regarded as a weaver of truth within dreams, though the revelations she grants are often laced with madness and fear.', '''alchemical'':142B ''allowing'':157B ''also'':97B ''and'':9B,29B,38B,71B,83B,103B,115B,137B,215B ''are'':210B ''artifact'':172B ''as'':24B,43B,154B,198B ''blood'':113B ''by'':21B,109B ''constantly'':53B ''control'':16B ''corruption'':90B,177B ''creat'':181B ''creation'':143B ''cults'':110B,139B ''daedric'':4B ''dark'':10B,101B,117B,182B ''delights'':87B ''desp'':82B ''despit'':191B ''destructiv'':104B ''distanc'':163B ''dream'':151B,166B ''dream-stat'':150B ''dreams'':8B,37B,204B ''dreamstrid'':156B ''dreamweav'':31B ''duplicat'':183B ''enter'':148B ''favor'':122B ''fear'':13B,216B ''fears'':72B ''feeding'':187B ''feeds'':67B ''followers'':128B ''for'':14B ''forms'':65B ''gain'':120B ''giv'':99B ''governs'':33B ''grants'':209B ''great'':162B ''her'':15B,46B,121B,125B,127B,141B,192B ''hopelessness'':84B ''horrors'':57B ''in'':88B,131B ''into'':61B ''involving'':133B ''is'':12B,51B,96B,107B,173B,196B ''its'':185B ''known'':20B,153B ''lac'':212B ''leaving'':76B ''madness'':214B ''magic'':118B ''malevolent'':193B ''memori'':70B,190B ''mind'':94B ''minions'':126B ''mistress'':26B ''mor'':63B ''morphs'':60B ''mortal'':93B ''mortals'':42B,74B ''most'':170B ''natur'':194B ''nightmar'':7B,28B,39B,136B ''notabl'':171B ''oblivion'':49B ''of'':6B,27B,36B,48B,56B,73B,81B,91B,100B,176B,184B,201B ''often'':40B,75B,129B,211B ''omens'':11B ''on'':68B,188B ''or'':123B,135B ''over'':17B ''partak'':130B ''perform'':112B ''plan'':47B ''portents'':102B ''princ'':5B ''progressively'':62B ''propheci'':105B ''quagmir'':50B ''reality'':59B ''realm'':55B ''regard'':197B ''revelations'':207B ''rituals'':132B ''s'':145B,169B ''sacrific'':114B ''scarr'':78B ''she'':32B,86B,95B,208B ''shifting'':54B ''skull'':175B ''sleep'':45B,134B ''som'':138B ''spher'':35B ''staff'':179B ''stat'':152B ''subconscious'':19B ''such'':23B ''summon'':124B ''terrifying'':64B ''that'':180B ''the'':3B,18B,25B,30B,34B,69B,89B,92B,98B,155B,158B,165B,174B,189B,206B ''them'':77B ''they'':44B ''though'':205B ''titl'':22B ''to'':119B,147B,160B ''tormenting'':41B ''torpor'':146B ''trav'':161B ''truth'':202B ''use'':116B,140B ''user'':159B ''vaermin'':1A,2B,66B,106B,144B,168B,195B ''victims'':186B ''visions'':80B ''weav'':200B ''wher'':58B ''whil'':85B ''who'':111B ''with'':79B,213B ''within'':164B,203B ''world'':167B ''worship'':108B', 'daedra, daedric, scholar', '

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('the_armorer''s_challenge', 'The Armorer''s Challenge, written by Mymophonus, recounts a dramatic contest between two armorsmiths: the renowned Sirollus Saccus and the modest Argonian craftsman Hazadir. Set during the reign of Empress Katariah, the story begins with her proposal to use Hazadir''s expertise to design armor suitable for the swampy terrain of Black Marsh, much to the disdain of the Imperial Council. To settle the matter, a competition is arranged: each armorer outfits a warrior-champion to duel, with the victor securing an Imperial commission. Despite Saccus’s technologically advanced forge and high-quality materials, Hazadir’s practical, swamp-optimized gear enables his champion to outwit and defeat his opponent.

The tale explores themes of practicality versus extravagance, the value of local knowledge, and the triumph of ingenuity over arrogance. Hazadir''s victory underscores the importance of understanding environmental conditions and enemy tactics, while Saccus’s failure highlights the pitfalls of overconfidence. The story concludes with Hazadir gaining the commission and Saccus departing for Morrowind in pursuit of wisdom, marking a poignant contrast between their approaches to craftsmanship and adaptability.

Torik’s childhood was defined by relentless servitude to his cruel uncle, performing tasks that demanded strength and repetitive motions. These grueling chores, such as ringing a heavy bell and sweeping with a long duster, unwittingly trained him for the physicality of wielding an axe. Torik’s transformation into an assassin began when his uncle, abandoning him without remorse, pushed Torik to retaliate. Using a Dwemer axe, Torik killed his uncle with the same motions he had perfected through years of servitude, marking the start of his lethal career.

Thematically, the book explores the interplay between oppression, survival, and the dark emergence of skill from trauma.

Ancient Tales of the Dwemer, Part XI: Azura and the Box, written by Marobar Sul, recounts a fable exploring Dwemer skepticism and divine power. The story follows Nchylbar, a wise Dwemer sage determined to test the limits of the gods'' omniscience. Assisted by a reluctant Chimer priest named Athynic, Nchylbar summons the Daedric Prince Azura and presents her with a sealed wooden box, challenging her to identify its contents. Azura declares the box holds a red-petaled flower, but when it is opened, it is empty. Though Azura vanishes in fury, a single red petal later falls from Nchylbar’s robe. The sage, content with his newfound understanding, dies peacefully that night, leaving an enigmatic truth behind.

The tale''s themes include the pursuit of knowledge, skepticism, and the complex relationship between mortals and divine beings. It reflects the Dwemer''s characteristic irreverence for the gods, which may have contributed to their mysterious disappearance from Tamriel. The story also contrasts various cultural interpretations, with Dunmer and Aldmeri versions presenting different outcomes, from Azura’s wrath to an intricate magical illusion.

However, Ulfric’s militia stormed Markarth, claiming the city for Skyrim. The book condemns Ulfric’s actions during and after the siege, detailing his ruthless execution of Forsworn officials, brutal torture of civilians, and indiscriminate killings of Nords and Reachfolk who did not support him. This bloodshed forced the Empire to accept Ulfric''s demands for free Talos worship, despite violating the White-Gold Concordat.

Themes of the book include the complexities of war, the morality of rebellion, and the cost of political compromise.

Biography of the Wolf Queen, written by Katar Eriphanes, chronicles the infamous life of Queen Potema, known as the Wolf Queen of Solitude. Born in 3E 67 to the Imperial family, Potema rose to power through her marriage to King Mantiarco of Solitude, leveraging her influence and intelligence to pursue an unrelenting ambition for dominance. The text details her manipulation of political alliances, involvement in civil war, and eventual rebellion against the Empire, culminating in the War of the Red Diamond. Potema''s relentless pursuit of power saw her employing necromancy, summoning daedra, and creating a kingdom of death and madness until her final defeat at the siege of Solitude in 3E 137.

The themes of Biography of the Wolf Queen include unchecked ambition, political manipulation, and the consequences of hubris. Potema''s story serves as a cautionary tale of how power, when sought without restraint or morality, can lead to ruin and infamy.

Master Voth Karlyss argues that Necromancy is inherently dangerous and morally corrupting, advocating for its prohibition to maintain the Guild’s ethical integrity and public trust. In contrast, Master Ulliceta gra-Kogg defends the study as essential for understanding and combating its practitioners, emphasizing that censoring knowledge undermines the Guild''s intellectual mission. Ultimately, Traven concludes that Necromancy’s risks outweigh its benefits, allowing limited and supervised study only for combating its misuse.

The Book of the Dragonborn, written by Prior Emelene Madrine, explores the significance, history, and mysteries surrounding the Dragonborn, individuals blessed by Akatosh with "dragon blood." The book traces the origins of the Dragonborn to the Covenant of Akatosh, when St. Alessia was granted divine power to light the Dragonfires and protect Tamriel from Oblivion. It examines how the title has historically been associated with the rulers of the Empire, from Alessia''s line to Tiber Septim and his heirs. However, it emphasizes that the Dragonborn is not purely hereditary, but a divine mystery that transcends bloodlines. The text delves into the Akaviri''s role in identifying and supporting Dragonborn, particularly Reman Cyrodiil, and raises questions about the nature of their powers and the possibility of multiple Dragonborn existing simultaneously.

Themes include divine intervention, legitimacy of rule, and the mystical connection between mortals and dragons. The book also highlights the prophecy of the Last Dragonborn, linking it to cataclysmic events such as the fall of towers and the awakening of the World-Eater, Alduin.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('brothers_of_darkness', 'The Brothers of Darkness, written by Pellarne Assi, explores the enigmatic origins and evolution of the Dark Brotherhood, Tamriel''s infamous guild of assassins. The text traces their roots to the Morag Tong, a Second Era religious cult devoted to the Daedric Prince Mephala. The Morag Tong''s shift to the Dark Brotherhood marked a significant transformation, as they transitioned from ritualistic murder to a profit-driven organization serving rulers and wealthy patrons. This shift solidified their role as both a feared cult and a necessary, albeit unlawful, institution across Tamriel.

The book highlights key historical moments, such as the assassination of Potentate Versidue-Shaie in 2E 324 and the infamous massacre of Emperor-Potentate Savirien-Chorak and his heirs in 2E 430.

Meridia is considered one of the few Daedric Princes who is not entirely malevolent, though her enemies view her as a force of obsessive order, and she is sometimes called the Lady of Greed. Her sphere of influence is largely focused on promoting purity within chaos and combating what she deems false-life, particularly necromancy. Her symbol is the sunburst, and she rules over a realm known as the Colored Rooms, inhabited by her Auroran servants.

Once believed to have been one of the Magne-Ge, divine beings who fled to Aetherius after the creation of Mundus, Meridia was cast out for consorting with forbidden powers.

Meridia, the Lady of Infinite Energies, is a Daedric Prince associated with life, light, and the energies of living things. Known for her hatred of the undead and necromancy, she rewards those who combat decay and false-life. Though not malevolent, she is sometimes viewed as obsessively orderly and called the Lady of Greed. Meridia''s realm, the Colored Rooms, is inhabited by her Auroran servants.

Complete Catalogue of Enchantments for Weaponry, written by Yvonne Bienne, outlines a range of enchantments that can be applied to weapons, though it acknowledges its incompleteness due to ongoing discoveries in magical practices. Common enchantments include elemental effects—fire, frost, and lightning—that harm foes on contact. Others drain magicka or stamina, weakening enemies without being directly lethal. Fear enchantments, targeting either the living or undead, cause affected creatures to flee, while soul trap enchantments bind the souls of defeated enemies to soul gems, a practice viewed as ethical only when used on non-sentient creatures.

Rarer enchantments include absorption effects that transfer health, magicka, or stamina from the victim to the wielder, with health absorption having lethal potential. The rarest enchantments are banishment, which severs summoned or raised creatures from their caster, and paralyzation, a highly sought-after effect that temporarily immobilizes foes, making them vulnerable.

Cats of Skyrim, written by Aldetuile, offers an account of the few feline species that inhabit the cold wilderness of Skyrim. The author’s primary focus is on the indigenous sabrecat, a large and dangerous predator with distinct physical adaptations, such as sharp front teeth and varied fur patterns. The common sabrecat features reddish-brown fur, while its snowy counterpart has spotted white fur, likely for stalking prey in snow-covered regions. These creatures use a combination of biting, clawing, and pouncing in their attacks.

The book also briefly mentions Khajiit outcasts living in Skyrim, though they remain elusive and unhelpful to the author’s research. The text highlights the practical uses of sabrecat pelts and teeth, which can be salvaged for crafting and alchemical purposes, such as creating stamina-restoring potions.

Chance''s Folly, written by Zylmoc Golge, tells the cautionary tale of Minevah Iolos, a skilled thief known as "Chance," whose ambition and betrayal lead to her demise. The story follows her partnership with Ulstyr Moresby, a seemingly mad Breton warrior, as they explore the Heran Ancestral Tomb in search of treasure. While Chance relies on her lockpicking prowess and cunning, Ulstyr’s cryptic ramblings and combat skills prove vital to their survival. However, as they delve deeper into the tomb, Chance grows suspicious of Ulstyr’s enigmatic knowledge, ultimately plotting to betray him once the treasure is found.

Themes of greed, mistrust, and divine intervention are central to the narrative. Chance''s overconfidence and disregard for her partner’s peculiar insights lead her to activate a trap that seals her inside the treasure room, leaving her to perish. Ulstyr returns two months later, fulfilling his eerie prophecy of "two months and back" to claim the gold.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('ysgramor', 'Ysgramor, often referred to as Ysgramor the Invader and known as "the harbinger of us all," is a legendary figure in Nordic history, celebrated as the first human ruler and king of Skyrim. He is said to have arrived in Tamriel from Atmora, fleeing a civil war, and is considered a pivotal character in the early struggles of humans against the Elves.

The Night of Tears, a tragic event in which the Snow Elves attacked the human settlement of Saarthal, is often attributed to tensions between the two races. While some Elven scholars claim that Ysgramor''s actions provoked this attack, many believe it was unprovoked, resulting in the massacre of most humans in the settlement, save for Ysgramor and his two sons, Yngol and Ylgar. After fleeing to Atmora, Ysgramor returned with the legendary Five Hundred Companions and launched a campaign against the Elves, successfully driving them from Skyrim and Solstheim. Wielding the axe Wuuthrad and accompanied by a Storm Atronach Bear summoned by his Clever Man, Alabar the Oddly-Colored, Ysgramor solidified his status as a cultural hero of the Nords.

Interviews With Tapestrists vol. 18: Cherim''s Heart of Anequina, written by Livillus Perus, features an interview with the renowned Khajiiti tapestry artist Cherim, whose work has gained recognition across the Empire. Cherim, known for his intricate and detailed depictions of historical and mythical events, discusses his famous tapestry "The Heart of Anequina," which portrays the turning point in the Five Year War between Elsweyr and Valenwood. The tapestry vividly illustrates the battle, focusing on the fear of Wood Elf archers and the distinctive traditional Khajiiti armor, contrasting it with the impracticality of the plate mail suggested by Nordic advisors. Cherim’s personal experiences as a soldier during the war, particularly at the Battle of Zelinin, influence his art, with his work showcasing both the practicality of Khajiiti armor and the tactical advantages it provided in battle.

Themes of cultural identity, the intersection of art and warfare, and the challenges of blending tradition with foreign influence emerge throughout Cherim''s reflections. The interview highlights Cherim’s meticulous attention to detail and his self-aware humor, evident in his inclusion of a self-portrait in the tapestry, poking fun at Khajiiti stereotypes. The book provides insight into how Cherim''s experiences shape his art, as well as the practical aspects of combat in Elsweyr, emphasizing how these elements are translated into the artistic medium of tapestry.', '''18'':8B ''across'':33B ''advantag'':136B ''advisors'':103B ''an'':19B ''and'':41B,46B,69B,85B,133B,149B,151B,174B ''anequin'':13B,56B ''archers'':84B ''are'':223B ''armor'':90B,132B ''art'':122B,148B,208B ''artist'':26B ''artistic'':227B ''as'':108B,209B,211B ''aspects'':214B ''at'':115B,194B ''attention'':171B ''awar'':178B ''battl'':76B,117B,140B ''betw'':67B ''blending'':155B ''book'':198B ''both'':127B ''by'':15B,101B ''challeng'':153B ''cherim'':1A,9B,27B,36B,104B,162B,168B,203B ''combat'':216B ''contrasting'':91B ''cultural'':143B ''depictions'':43B ''detail'':42B,173B ''discuss'':49B ''distinctiv'':87B ''during'':111B ''elements'':222B ''elf'':83B ''elsweyr'':68B,218B ''emerg'':160B ''emphasizing'':219B ''empir'':35B ''events'':48B ''evident'':180B ''experienc'':107B,205B ''famous'':51B ''fear'':80B ''featur'':18B ''fiv'':64B ''focusing'':77B ''for'':38B ''foreign'':158B ''fun'':193B ''gain'':31B ''heart'':3A,11B,54B ''highlights'':167B ''his'':39B,50B,121B,124B,175B,182B,207B ''historical'':45B ''how'':202B,220B ''humor'':179B ''identity'':144B ''illustrat'':74B ''impracticality'':95B ''in'':62B,139B,181B,189B,217B ''inclusion'':183B ''influenc'':120B,159B ''insight'':200B ''intersection'':146B ''interview'':20B,166B ''interviews'':4B ''into'':201B,225B ''intricat'':40B ''it'':92B,137B ''khajiiti'':24B,89B,131B,195B ''known'':37B ''livillus'':16B ''mail'':99B ''medium'':228B ''meticulous'':170B ''mythical'':47B ''nordic'':102B ''of'':12B,44B,55B,81B,96B,118B,130B,142B,147B,154B,184B,215B,229B ''on'':78B ''particularly'':114B ''personal'':106B ''perus'':17B ''plat'':98B ''point'':61B ''poking'':192B ''portrait'':188B ''portrays'':58B ''practical'':213B ''practicality'':129B ''provid'':138B,199B ''recognition'':32B ''reflections'':164B ''renown'':23B ''s'':2A,10B,105B,163B,169B,204B ''self'':177B,187B ''self-awar'':176B ''self-portrait'':186B ''shap'':206B ''showcasing'':126B ''soldi'':110B ''stereotyp'':196B ''suggest'':100B ''tactical'':135B ''tapestrists'':6B ''tapestry'':25B,52B,72B,191B,230B ''the'':22B,34B,53B,59B,63B,71B,75B,79B,86B,94B,97B,112B,116B,128B,134B,145B,152B,165B,190B,197B,212B,226B ''them'':141B ''thes'':221B ''throughout'':161B ''to'':172B ''tradition'':156B ''traditional'':88B ''translat'':224B ''turning'':60B ''valenwood'':70B ''vividly'':73B ''vol'':7B ''war'':66B,113B ''warfar'':150B ''well'':210B ''which'':57B ''whos'':28B ''with'':5B,21B,93B,123B,157B ''wood'':82B ''work'':29B,125B ''writt'':14B ''year'':65B ''zelinin'':119B', 'scholar', '

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('children_of_the_sky', 'Children of the Sky, written by Yvonne Bienne, explores the culture and mystical powers of the Nords, focusing particularly on their connection to the Thu''um, or Shout. The Nords view themselves as the "children of the sky," believing that their land, Skyrim, was formed when the sky exhaled upon it. This powerful, spiritual connection to the sky is reflected in their unique ability to use their breath as a weapon and form of expression, most notably through the Thu''um. The strongest Nords, called "Tongues," can harness this power to perform extraordinary feats, such as knocking down doors with a single shout or striking enemies with forceful roars. The book delves into the significance of speech in their culture, with the greatest warriors being those who can wield their voices to instill fear, command, or even travel vast distances.

The themes of power, identity, and elemental force permeate the text, illustrating the Nords’ deep connection to the elements of Skyrim, particularly wind, which is central to their nature.

Tharstan is struck by their hospitality, simplicity, and unique worldview. The Skaal follow a faith centered around the All-Maker, a single deity who is the source of all life and creation. In their belief system, death is not an end but a transformation, with the spirit returning to the All-Maker to be reshaped and sent back into the world. This cycle of life and death is central to their respect for all living things, which is reflected in their sustainable lifestyle. They hunt only out of necessity, make minimal impact on their environment, and live in harmony with the land.

The book also touches on the challenges the Skaal face, particularly their dwindling numbers due to the harsh climate of Solstheim and the impact of ashfall from the eruption of Vvardenfell. Tharstan laments the loss of their way of life, foreseeing a future where the Skaal''s customs may be forgotten. Despite these struggles, the Skaal''s reverence for life and their austere yet harmonious existence remain poignant. The themes of respect for nature, simplicity, and the passage of life resonate throughout the text.

Initially designed as a powerful ally to the Chimer in their war against the Dwemer, the golem malfunctioned during an attack on the Dwemer camp, leading to disastrous results. The story culminates with a twist: the golem, which the Chimer thought was an unstoppable force, is revealed to be Jnaggo in disguise, using his skills in armor and magic to deceive the Chimer and help the Dwemer win the battle.

The themes of deception, the role of technology and magic in warfare, and the hubris of the Chimer are central to the story.

The Dragon Break Reexamined, written by Fal Droon, explores the historical error that led to the myth of the "Dragon Break" and its lasting impact on Tamrielic history. The concept of the Dragon Break, widely accepted as an event during Tiber Septim''s rise to power, was based on a timeline error in the Encyclopedia Tamrielica due to misinterpretations of Alessian records. The book argues that this error, compounded by obsession with religious and eschatological themes, became entrenched in historical accounts, despite the absence of solid evidence for such an event. Droon''s work reveals that the actual historical period of the Alessians was much shorter than traditionally believed, and the Dragon Break was a product of scholarly misunderstanding and the repetition of faulty traditions.

The themes of the book center around the fallibility of historical records, the dangers of relying on outdated or erroneous traditions, and the way myths can be perpetuated through scholarly inertia.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('ruptga', 'Ruptga, known as Tall Papa, is the chief deity of the Yokudan and Redguard pantheon and a central figure in their mythology. As the first spirit to escape the endless cycles of creation and destruction brought by Satakal, the Worldskin, Ruptga is revered as the god who charted the path to the Far Shores, the sanctuary beyond the cycles of hunger. Using his immense height, he placed the stars in the sky to serve as a guiding map for other spirits seeking escape. However, Ruptga’s role is not only that of a savior; he also acted as a judge, punishing Sep, the Second Serpent, for deceiving spirits into inhabiting the mortal world, which left them vulnerable to hunger and mortality. The void left by Sep’s death remains as a hungry force chasing the stars, a haunting reminder of his trickery.

Worship of Ruptga is rich in symbolism, often featuring star motifs that reflect his role as the celestial guide. He is associated with the color purple, which adorns prayer beads dedicated to him. Myths also link Ruptga to his divine family, including his daughter Leki, the goddess of swordsmanship, and his estranged son Zeht, the god of agriculture, who renounced him after the world’s creation. Ruptga''s legacy is woven into Redguard culture, with his influence reflected in their oaths, exclamations, and spiritual practices. As the architect of the stars and protector of the Far Shores, Ruptga embodies the ideals of guidance, judgment, and perseverance amidst the cycles of life and death.', '''acted'':98B ''adorns'':171B ''after'':205B ''agricultur'':201B ''also'':97B,178B ''amidst'':250B ''and'':14B,17B,35B,121B,193B,226B,235B,248B,255B ''architect'':231B ''as'':4B,24B,45B,76B,99B,131B,159B,229B ''associat'':165B ''beads'':173B ''beyond'':58B ''brought'':37B ''by'':38B,126B ''celestial'':161B ''central'':19B ''chart'':49B ''chasing'':135B ''chief'':9B ''color'':168B ''creation'':34B,209B ''cultur'':217B ''cycles'':32B,60B,252B ''daught'':187B ''death'':129B,256B ''deceiving'':108B ''dedicat'':174B ''deity'':10B ''destruction'':36B ''divin'':183B ''embodi'':242B ''endless'':31B ''escap'':29B,84B ''estrang'':195B ''exclamations'':225B ''family'':184B ''far'':54B,239B ''featuring'':152B ''figur'':20B ''first'':26B ''for'':80B,107B ''forc'':134B ''god'':47B,199B ''goddess'':190B ''guid'':162B ''guidanc'':246B ''guiding'':78B ''haunting'':139B ''height'':66B ''him'':176B,204B ''his'':64B,142B,157B,182B,186B,194B,219B ''howev'':85B ''hung'':62B,120B ''hungry'':133B ''ideals'':244B ''immens'':65B ''in'':21B,71B,149B,222B ''including'':185B ''influenc'':220B ''inhabiting'':111B ''into'':110B,215B ''is'':7B,43B,89B,147B,164B,213B ''judg'':101B ''judgment'':247B ''known'':3B ''left'':116B,125B ''legacy'':212B ''leki'':188B ''lif'':254B ''link'':179B ''map'':79B ''mortal'':113B ''mortality'':122B ''motifs'':154B ''mythology'':23B ''myths'':177B ''not'':90B ''oaths'':224B ''of'':11B,33B,61B,93B,141B,145B,191B,200B,232B,237B,245B,253B ''often'':151B ''only'':91B ''other'':81B ''pantheon'':16B ''pap'':6B ''path'':51B ''perseveranc'':249B ''plac'':68B ''practic'':228B ''pray'':172B ''protector'':236B ''punishing'':102B ''purpl'':169B ''redguard'':15B,216B ''reflect'':156B,221B ''remains'':130B ''remind'':140B ''renounc'':203B ''rever'':44B ''rich'':148B ''rol'':88B,158B ''ruptg'':1A,2B,42B,86B,146B,180B,210B,241B ''s'':87B,128B,208B,211B ''sanctuary'':57B ''satakal'':39B ''savior'':95B ''second'':105B ''seeking'':83B ''sep'':103B,127B ''serpent'':106B ''serv'':75B ''shor'':55B,240B ''sky'':73B ''spirit'':27B ''spirits'':82B,109B ''spiritual'':227B ''star'':153B ''stars'':70B,137B,234B ''swordsmanship'':192B ''symbolism'':150B ''tall'':5B ''that'':92B,155B ''the'':8B,12B,22B,25B,30B,40B,46B,50B,53B,56B,59B,69B,72B,104B,112B,123B,136B,160B,167B,189B,198B,206B,223B,230B,233B,238B,243B,251B ''them'':117B ''to'':28B,52B,74B,119B,175B,181B ''trickery'':143B ''using'':63B ''void'':124B ''vulner'':118B ''which'':115B,170B ''who'':48B,202B ''with'':166B,218B ''world'':114B,207B ''worldskin'':41B ''worship'':144B ''wov'':214B ''yokud'':13B ''zeht'':197B', 'redguard, scholar', 'Ruptga, also known as Tall Papa, is the chief deity in the Yokudan and Redguard pantheon.

While the Direnni clan is known for its notable warriors and kings, Vorian emphasizes the significance of Asliel, an alchemist from humble beginnings, who transformed the practice of potion-making into an art and science. Asliel''s expertise in herbology led him to create powerful remedies and poisons, including a legendary invisibility potion that saved his people from the barbarian Locvar tribe. Asliel’s discoveries in alchemy, notably his work with vampire dust and other rare ingredients, became foundational to the art of alchemy as it is known in Tamriel.

The book intertwines historical narrative with personal reflections on the Direnni clan’s cultural and scientific achievements. Themes of legacy, knowledge, and the evolution of magical practices resonate throughout the text, illustrating how one individual''s innovations can shape the future. The book also touches on the broader impact of the Direnni clan''s contributions, including Asliel’s eventual role as a Psijic, helping to establish the modern understanding of alchemy.

The Death Blow of Abernanit, written by Anonymous, is an epic poem recounting the siege and eventual fall of Abernanit, a stronghold held by the Daedric-worshipper Dagoth Thras. The story centers around the legendary battle between the Temple Ordinators, led by the heroic Rangidil Ketil, and the forces of Dagoth Thras, who wields an impenetrable shield blessed by Mehrunes Dagon, a Daedric Prince. Despite the overwhelming strength of Dagoth Thras, Rangidil perseveres, ultimately delivering the "death blow" after realizing that his opponent''s defense was not invincible. The tale showcases themes of divine favor, perseverance, and the cost of pride, highlighting the importance of wisdom in battle.

Geocrates Varnus, who offers explanatory notes on the poem, clarifies the historical context, including the significance of the Tribunal and the divine blessings Rangidil received. The poem not only glorifies the victory over an oppressive tyrant but also emphasizes the role of divine intervention and the limits of power, even for the most formidable warriors. This poem is part of a larger collection of legends from Morrowind''s history, and although it is singular in its telling, it holds a prominent place in the cultural narratives surrounding the Tribunal and their divine influence.', '''abernanit'':4A,9B,24B ''after'':84B ''also'':151B ''although'':184B ''an'':14B,60B,147B ''and'':20B,52B,102B,133B,158B,183B,203B ''anonymous'':12B ''around'':38B ''battl'':41B,113B ''betw'':42B ''bless'':63B ''blessings'':136B ''blow'':2A,7B,83B ''but'':150B ''by'':11B,28B,47B,64B ''centers'':37B ''clarifi'':123B ''collection'':176B ''context'':126B ''cost'':104B ''cultural'':198B ''daedric'':31B,68B ''daedric-worshipp'':30B ''dagon'':66B ''dagoth'':33B,56B,75B ''death'':1A,6B,82B ''defens'':90B ''delivering'':80B ''despit'':70B ''divin'':99B,135B,156B,205B ''emphasiz'':152B ''epic'':15B ''even'':163B ''eventual'':21B ''explanatory'':118B ''fall'':22B ''favor'':100B ''for'':164B ''forc'':54B ''formid'':167B ''from'':179B ''geocrat'':114B ''glorifi'':143B ''held'':27B ''heroic'':49B ''highlighting'':107B ''his'':87B ''historical'':125B ''history'':182B ''holds'':192B ''impenetr'':61B ''importanc'':109B ''in'':112B,188B,196B ''including'':127B ''influenc'':206B ''intervention'':157B ''invinc'':93B ''is'':13B,171B,186B ''it'':185B,191B ''its'':189B ''ketil'':51B ''larg'':175B ''led'':46B ''legendary'':40B ''legends'':178B ''limits'':160B ''mehrun'':65B ''morrowind'':180B ''most'':166B ''narrativ'':199B ''not'':92B,119B,141B ''of'':3A,8B,23B,55B,74B,98B,105B,110B,130B,155B,161B,173B,177B ''offers'':117B ''on'':120B ''only'':142B ''opponent'':88B ''oppressiv'':148B ''ordinators'':45B ''over'':146B ''overwhelming'':72B ''part'':172B ''persever'':78B ''perseveranc'':101B ''plac'':195B ''poem'':16B,122B,140B,170B ''pow'':162B ''prid'':106B ''princ'':69B ''prominent'':194B ''rangidil'':50B,77B,137B ''realizing'':85B ''receiv'':138B ''recounting'':17B ''rol'':154B ''s'':89B,181B ''shield'':62B ''showc'':96B ''sieg'':19B ''significanc'':129B ''singul'':187B ''story'':36B ''strength'':73B ''stronghold'':26B ''surrounding'':200B ''tal'':95B ''telling'':190B ''templ'':44B ''that'':86B ''the'':5B,18B,29B,35B,39B,43B,48B,53B,71B,81B,94B,103B,108B,121B,124B,128B,131B,134B,139B,144B,153B,159B,165B,197B,201B,204B ''them'':97B ''this'':169B ''thras'':34B,57B,76B ''tribunal'':132B,202B ''tyrant'':149B ''ultimately'':79B ''varnus'':115B ''victory'':145B ''warriors'':168B ''was'':91B ''who'':58B,116B ''wields'':59B ''wisdom'':111B ''worshipp'':32B ''writt'':10B', 'scholar', '

The Death of a Wanderer, written by Anonymous, is a tale of an Argonian who meets a tragic end after venturing into a Draugr crypt. The story is told through the eyes of a companion, who recounts the final moments of the Argonian''s life as he reflects on his failed attempt to use a mysterious claw he had found in an ancient crypt. The claw, believed to be a key for opening sealing doors in crypts, holds an important revelation about the Draugr: the symbols on the doors were not just locks, but a mechanism to ensure that only the living could enter, while the Draugr were trapped inside.

The themes of the story revolve around the dangers of seeking forbidden knowledge, the wisdom gained through hardship, and the ironies of life and death.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('dwemer_history_and_culture', 'Collected Essays on Dwemer History and Culture, written by Hasphat Antabolis, opens with a critical examination of Marobar Sul''s Ancient Tales of the Dwemer, a popular but historically flawed account of the Dwemer people. Antabolis argues that despite being debunked by scholars since the reign of Katariah I, Sul''s work has remained influential in popular culture, shaping the image of the Dwemer as eccentric, approachable figures rather than the mysterious and often unsettling race they truly were. Written by the pseudonymous Gor Felim, Sul’s tales were originally intended as light entertainment for the masses, presenting the Dwemer in a more familiar, humanized light that resonated with a human-centric worldview. Antabolis critiques this version, noting that it contributed to a lasting myth of the Dwemer that oversimplifies their complex and often unsettling history.

The themes of the essay revolve around the dangers of historical misrepresentation and the power of popular fiction to shape cultural perceptions. Antabolis contrasts Sul’s portrayal with the more foreboding and mysterious depictions of the Dwemer found in other cultures, such as the Redguard and Nord legends, which present the Dwemer as powerful and enigmatic. The essay reflects on the tension between these mythologized versions and the more complex, often unflattering realities of the Dwemer, urging a deeper and more nuanced understanding of this lost race.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('dwemer_inquiries', 'Dwemer Inquiries: Their Architecture and Civilization, written by Thelwe Ghelein, is a scholarly exploration of the Dwemer people, their architectural practices, and the mysteries surrounding their disappearance. Ghelein''s work is divided into three volumes, each delving deeper into various aspects of Dwemer culture. In Volume I, he examines the differing architectural styles found in Dwemer ruins across Tamriel, particularly comparing those in Vvardenfell with those in Skyrim and Hammerfell. Ghelein challenges the traditional belief that the Dwemer were most prolific in Vvardenfell, proposing instead that different clans, particularly after the Rourken Clan''s departure, developed distinct building techniques and perhaps even hidden their strongholds more cleverly as time progressed.

Volume II focuses on the Dwemer''s intellectual pursuits, particularly their emphasis on logic and science over magic, contrasting their societal structure with that of other mer cultures. Ghelein suggests that Dwemer society elevated scholars, such as tonal architects, to a level akin to religious leaders, and explores their architectural "Deep Venues" and "Arcanex," which served as centers for study. In Volume III, Ghelein shifts focus to the depth and complexity of Dwemer excavations, with particular attention given to the "geocline," a marker indicating where significant city structures began. He speculates on the meaning of enigmatic terms like "Fal''Zhardum Din," found in the deepest parts of Dwemer ruins, hinting at an elusive secret that may lie buried in Dwemer history.

Despite being offered as an ally during the Dragon War, Miraak refused to aid humanity and was later defeated in a duel by the Dragon Priest Vahlok, who uncovered his treachery.

Effects of the Elder Scrolls, written by Justinius Poluhnius, is a scholarly examination of the profound and often dangerous effects that the Elder Scrolls have on their readers. Poluhnius categorizes these effects into four distinct groups, depending on the reader''s level of knowledge and mental fortitude. The first group, The Naifs, consists of those who lack sufficient understanding to interpret the scrolls, leaving them unaffected but also unable to glean any knowledge. The second group, The Unguarded Intellects, experiences the greatest danger, suffering total blindness upon reading, though they gain a fragment of forbidden knowledge. The third group, Mediated Understanding, includes the trained initiates of the Cult of the Ancestor Moth, who, through years of mental discipline, can read the scrolls with minimal blindness and gain tempered insights. Finally, Illuminated Understanding describes the advanced monks who experience progressive blindness but gain an increasingly profound comprehension of the scrolls'' revelations, culminating in a final, irreversible reading.

The theme of the book revolves around the perils and mysteries of seeking forbidden knowledge and the costs associated with understanding the Elder Scrolls. It highlights the discipline required to safely access such knowledge and the toll it takes on both the mind and body. The text serves as both a cautionary tale and a scholarly guide for those seeking to engage with the scrolls, offering insights into their powerful effects and the philosophy behind the Cult of the Ancestor Moth''s teachings.', '''access'':193B ''advanc'':140B ''also'':73B ''an'':148B ''ancestor'':116B,241B ''and'':22B,50B,131B,171B,177B,196B,205B,215B,233B ''any'':77B ''around'':168B ''as'':210B ''associat'':180B ''behind'':236B ''blindness'':91B,130B,145B ''body'':206B ''book'':166B ''both'':202B,211B ''but'':72B,146B ''by'':12B ''can'':124B ''categoriz'':35B ''cautionary'':213B ''comprehension'':151B ''consists'':58B ''costs'':179B ''culminating'':156B ''cult'':113B,238B ''dang'':88B ''dangerous'':24B ''depending'':42B ''describ'':138B ''disciplin'':123B,189B ''distinct'':40B ''effects'':1A,6B,25B,37B,232B ''elder'':4A,9B,28B,184B ''engag'':223B ''examination'':18B ''experienc'':85B,143B ''final'':159B ''finally'':135B ''first'':54B ''for'':219B ''forbidd'':100B,175B ''fortitud'':52B ''four'':39B ''fragment'':98B ''gain'':96B,132B,147B ''gle'':76B ''greatest'':87B ''group'':55B,81B,104B ''groups'':41B ''guid'':218B ''hav'':30B ''highlights'':187B ''illuminat'':136B ''in'':157B ''includ'':107B ''increasingly'':149B ''initiat'':110B ''insights'':134B,228B ''intellects'':84B ''interpret'':66B ''into'':38B,229B ''irrevers'':160B ''is'':15B ''it'':186B,199B ''justinius'':13B ''knowledg'':49B,78B,101B,176B,195B ''lack'':62B ''leaving'':69B ''level'':47B ''mediat'':105B ''mental'':51B,122B ''mind'':204B ''minimal'':129B ''monks'':141B ''moth'':117B,242B ''mysteri'':172B ''naifs'':57B ''of'':2A,7B,19B,48B,59B,99B,111B,114B,121B,152B,164B,173B,239B ''offering'':227B ''often'':23B ''on'':31B,43B,201B ''perils'':170B ''philosophy'':235B ''poluhnius'':14B,34B ''powerful'':231B ''profound'':21B,150B ''progressiv'':144B ''read'':45B,125B ''readers'':33B ''reading'':93B,161B ''requir'':190B ''revelations'':155B ''revolv'':167B ''s'':46B,243B ''safely'':192B ''scholarly'':17B,217B ''scrolls'':5A,10B,29B,68B,127B,154B,185B,226B ''second'':80B ''seeking'':174B,221B ''serv'':209B ''such'':194B ''suffering'':89B ''sufficient'':63B ''tak'':200B ''tal'':214B ''teachings'':244B ''temper'':133B ''text'':208B ''that'':26B ''the'':3A,8B,20B,27B,32B,44B,53B,56B,67B,79B,82B,86B,102B,108B,112B,115B,126B,139B,153B,162B,165B,169B,178B,183B,188B,197B,203B,207B,225B,230B,234B,237B,240B ''them'':70B,163B ''thes'':36B ''they'':95B ''third'':103B ''thos'':60B,220B ''though'':94B ''through'':119B ''to'':65B,75B,191B,222B ''toll'':198B ''total'':90B ''train'':109B ''unabl'':74B ''unaffect'':71B ''understanding'':64B,106B,137B,182B ''unguard'':83B ''upon'':92B ''who'':61B,118B,142B ''with'':128B,181B,224B ''writt'':11B ''years'':120B', 'scholar', 'Effects of the Elder Scrolls, you do not know the author of the book and have limited knowledge of it, is a scholarly examination of the dangerous and transformative effects of the Elder Scrolls on readers, categorized by their mental preparedness and understanding.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('fall_of_the_snow_prince', 'Fall of the Snow Prince, written by Lokheim, is a poignant account of the Battle of the Moesring, where the Nords faced a devastating foe in the form of the Snow Prince, an elf whose arrival inspired both awe and terror. The battle is set against the backdrop of a final stand between the Nords and the Elves on Solstheim, with the Snow Prince leading the Elven forces. As the battle rages, the Snow Prince’s formidable power and eerie presence on the battlefield turn the tide in favor of the Elves, and many of the Nords'' bravest warriors fall to his spear. However, in a twist of fate, it is the young daughter of a slain warrior, Finna, who avenges her mother by throwing a sword that fatally strikes the Snow Prince, causing his death and breaking the spirit of the Elven forces.

The themes of the story revolve around honor, fate, and the tragic inevitability of death, as even the mightiest warrior can be felled by an unexpected force. The Snow Prince, despite being an enemy, is respected for his skill and bravery, and his death marks the end of an era. The Nords'' reverence for his valor is reflected in their burial practices, where the Snow Prince is honored despite being their foe. This tale is both a reflection on the brutal nature of warfare and a meditation on the respect that warriors, regardless of their allegiance, can earn through their deeds.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('father_of_the_niben', 'Father of the Niben, written by Florin Jaliil, is a translation of the fragmented journal of Topal the Pilot, an Aldmeri explorer from the Merethic Era. The account chronicles Topal’s journey, during which he sails across Tamriel with a crew, tasked with finding a way back to Old Ehlnofey and discovering new lands. Throughout his voyages, Topal encounters many wonders, including strange islands, dangerous creatures, and various tribes. However, his journey is marred by miscalculations, mistaken turns, and a failure to reach his intended destination, Firsthold. The account is fragmented, leaving readers with more questions than answers, particularly regarding Topal’s encounters with ancient Khajiit, Orcs, and other civilizations, which would later become extinct or forgotten.

The themes of the story revolve around exploration, failure, and the uncertainty of discovery. Topal’s journey is one of ambition and perseverance, yet ultimately, he fails to achieve his initial goals, though he leaves behind maps that contribute significantly to later understanding of Tamriel’s geography. His encounters with different cultures highlight the diversity of Tamriel, while his miscalculations serve as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of exploration.

Set during the Second Era, Thaurbad lives a solitary life, communicating only through written words after losing his voice. His discovery of the magical Feyfolken quill leads him to great artistic and professional success, as it brings his mundane writings to life with divine beauty. However, the quill''s magic takes a sinister turn, gradually driving Thaurbad to madness and ultimately leading to his tragic death.

The narrative explores the complexities of magical influence and the moral consequences of using enchanted tools, particularly in the context of Thaurbad’s transformation from a humble scribe to a cursed artist.

Fire and Darkness: The Brotherhoods of Death, written by Ynir Gorming, is a historical examination of the Morag Tong, an ancient assassin guild of Morrowind, and its eventual split into the infamous Dark Brotherhood. The text delves into the origins of the Morag Tong, its worship of Sithis and Mephala, and its role in Morrowind''s political landscape. The book highlights key events, such as the Morag Tong''s assassination of Emperor Reman and its subsequent outlawing, leading to the formation of the Dark Brotherhood, a secular organization that continued the tradition of assassination for profit, but diverged from the Tong''s religious ties. Themes of secrecy, betrayal, and the shifting nature of power are explored, emphasizing the moral and philosophical divisions between the two guilds.

The book also touches upon the enduring conflict between the Morag Tong and the Dark Brotherhood, rooted in religious schism, with the Dark Brotherhood continuing to revere Mephala, despite the Morag Tong’s eventual abandonment of her worship in favor of Vivec. The text presents a detailed, often grim, exploration of the assassination guilds and their influence on Tamriel''s history.

The Firmament, written by Ffoulke, is a detailed exploration of the constellations and their meanings in the night sky of Tamriel, focusing on their connection to the birthsigns and their influence over individuals. The book categorizes the stars into thirteen constellations, three of which are major and known as the Guardians: The Warrior, The Mage, and The Thief. These Guardians protect their respective Charges, and each has a specific Season when it holds power. The work delves into the characteristics of each constellation and its associated birthsigns, explaining their roles and how they affect those born under their influence. It also explores the Serpent, a rogue constellation that moves independently and does not have a fixed Season.

Themes of destiny, influence, and the interplay between the stars and individuals'' fates are central to the book. The constellations are depicted as powerful and symbolic forces, with each influencing certain traits, strengths, and weaknesses in those born under their signs.

The Firsthold Revolt, written by Maveus Cie, tells the story of political intrigue and betrayal within the city of Firsthold, Summerset Isle. The tale centers around the tension between Lady Gialene, the powerful concubine of King Reman, and Queen Morgiah, her rival for influence in the court. Gialene seeks to incite a revolt with the help of the Trebbite Monks, a faction that opposes the Dunmer influence in the royal family. As the revolt escalates, Gialene orchestrates a dangerous strategy using reflection spells to counter the King''s fireball-wielding battlemages. However, her plot backfires, leading to chaos, betrayal, and her eventual return to her father''s court, while the king''s forces remain in control.

The first four songs recount his feats, including the defeat of Orcish forces, the rebuilding of High Hrothgar, and his eventual rise from death as the Ash King, leading an army to reclaim the Heart of Shor. However, the fifth song reveals the tragic conclusion of his campaign, as he is betrayed by Dagoth-Ur, and the Nords face their ultimate defeat. The final song introduces an apocryphal narrative, presenting the secret history of Wulfharth''s conflict with the Tribunal and the betrayal that led to the fall of Red Mountain.

The themes of the songs include the power of destiny, the complexities of betrayal, and the consequences of seeking vengeance. The struggle between loyalty to one''s people and the manipulation of gods and powers beyond mortal comprehension is central to the narrative.

An Overview of Gods and Worship in Tamriel, written by Brother Hetchfield, explores the relationship between mortals and the gods in Tamriel, focusing on the enigmatic and sometimes contradictory role that deities play in the lives of their followers. Hetchfield examines the gods'' direct involvement in mortal affairs, noting that while divine intervention is evident in some heroic tales and legendary events, it is often absent during times of widespread suffering, such as plagues or famines. He speculates that the gods may derive power from the worship, deeds, and sacrifices of their followers, with larger temples having more influence due to their greater number of worshippers. The book also discusses the possibility that certain spirits, by gaining strength through worship, might ascend to the status of gods or goddesses, hinting at a fluid and evolving nature of divinity in Tamriel.

The themes of the book revolve around the nature of divine influence, the mystery surrounding gods'' actions, and the power of mortal devotion. Hetchfield presents the gods as distant and indifferent at times, yet also responsive to sincere devotion and deeds. The book suggests that understanding the connection between gods and mortals is an ongoing challenge, influenced by various interpretations and beliefs across cultures.

The book is divided into three volumes, each covering significant events and challenges faced by the town over the centuries. The first volume covers the town''s founding in 3E 427, the initial imperial settlement, and the eruption of Red Mountain in 4E 5, which caused widespread destruction but ultimately solidified Raven Rock''s resilience. The second volume details the construction of protective structures like the Bulwark, the transition of control to House Redoran, and the prosperity that followed under the leadership of Brara Morvayn. The third volume chronicles the challenges Raven Rock faced during the Fourth Era, including internal strife from House Hlaalu, the depletion of the ebony mine, and the ongoing efforts to maintain order and security under Lleril Morvayn’s rule.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('invocation_of_azura', 'Invocation of Azura, written by Sigillah Parate, is a work that emphasizes the author''s personal journey of devotion to Azura, the Daedric Princess of Moonshadow. The book recounts the author''s experiences as a priestess of Azura after having previously served under other Daedric Princes, including Molag Bal, Boethiah, and Nocturnal. It outlines the differences between these deities, highlighting Azura''s unique qualities—her compassion for her followers, the depth of her emotional engagement, and her focus on the genuine love and devotion of those who worship her. In contrast to the more impersonal and demanding nature of the other Daedric Princes, Azura’s attention to the emotional connection and self-reflection of her followers sets her apart.

The central theme of the book is the superiority of Azura over other Daedric Princes, as the author argues that Azura is not only a source of power but also a nurturing figure who cares deeply for her followers'' inner emotional states. This devotion to Azura, with its emphasis on authentic love and self-acceptance, is presented as both a personal and philosophical commitment.

As he grows in strength, he leads his people in rebellion against the invading Empress Hestra, but despite his fierce resistance, the Reach falls under Imperial control. Faolan makes a pact with an ancient Hagraven, gaining power at the cost of his humanity, and continues his fight for freedom. The tale ends with his death, but not before he swears his sword will be returned to his people when the Reach is finally free.

The story explores themes of destiny, sacrifice, and the consequences of power, particularly the cost of alliances made with dark forces. The narrative also emphasizes the unyielding spirit of the Reach and the eternal struggle for freedom against oppressive invaders. The legend, though rooted in the distant past, remains relevant in the context of the Reach''s long history of resistance and rebellion.

Set in 3E 405 during the celebrations in Camlorn, the story begins with Gyna, a prostitute who unknowingly looks like the royal family, encountering Lady Jyllia, the King''s daughter. Their connection leads Gyna to recall long-forgotten memories of her childhood, including the tragic assassination of the royal family and her fall from a castle window, which caused her to lose her memory. Throughout the narrative, Gyna, now self-identified as Princess Talara, embarks on a journey to uncover her past, aided by Lord Strale, an Imperial ambassador, and others involved in a complex conspiracy.

Themes in Mystery of Talara include memory, identity, betrayal, and the manipulation of power within royal families. The story explores how trauma can erase and distort memories, and the lengths individuals will go to conceal dark truths.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('mythic_dawn_commentaries', 'Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes, written by Mankar Camoran, is a multi-part series that serves as the foundational text for initiates into the Mythic Dawn cult. The series explores the philosophy and beliefs of the cult, primarily focused on the worship of Lord Dagon and the pursuit of freedom and power through destruction. The books are filled with esoteric language, cryptic teachings, and spiritual revelations, guiding followers through a journey of self-destruction and rebirth. The narrative describes a transformative process in which initiates must abandon their past selves and embrace the keys to a new existence. Each book focuses on different aspects of the cult''s rituals, including the importance of submitting to the destructive forces of Lord Dagon, embracing chaos, and shedding the old identity to reach a state of divine freedom.

The overarching themes of Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes revolve around liberation through destruction, the rejection of established order, and the embrace of chaos as a path to power. The series teaches that only through the complete breakdown of personal and societal structures can true freedom and understanding be achieved. Mankar Camoran''s writing emphasizes the concept of "Nu-mantia," or liberty, and the importance of free will in shaping one''s destiny. The hidden message formed by the first letters of each paragraph ("Green Emperor/Way Where/Tower Touches/Midday Sun") hints at a deeper, mystic connection to the power and influence of the Mythic Dawn. The work is dense and philosophical, with elements of mysticism, rebellion, and apocalyptic prophecy.

In another, he teaches King Lyandir a lesson in creativity and madness by ensuring every child born in the city is born mad, eventually leading to the king''s death at the hands of his deranged son.

Nerevar''s victory at Red Mountain and his honor in respecting the Ancient Spirits and Tribal law are celebrated, but his assassination by power-hungry leaders from the Great Houses, who later claimed godhood, marks a tragic turn. The legend suggests that Nerevar will one day return to fulfill his promises to the Tribes, overthrow the false gods, and restore the honor of the Dunmer.

Themes of betrayal, the struggle for power, and the preservation of tradition versus corruption are central to this work.

It criticizes the Empire for betraying the Nord people by forbidding the worship of Talos and accuses King Torygg of treason for agreeing to a pact with the Thalmor.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('olaf_and_the_dragon', 'Olaf and the Dragon, written by Adonato Leotelli, explores the legendary tale of Olaf One-Eye, a hero who defeated the dragon Numinex in an epic battle for Skyrim''s future. The dragon, a terrifying force that had ravaged Skyrim, was eventually confronted by Olaf, a warrior who would later become the High King of Skyrim. The legend tells of Olaf''s battle against Numinex atop Mount Athor, where the two engage in a brutal shouting contest that shatters the land. Ultimately, Olaf triumphs, capturing the dragon and bringing him to Whiterun, where the beast is imprisoned in a place that would become known as Dragonsreach. Olaf''s victory solidifies his leadership, ending a bitter war of succession among Skyrim''s holds.

Themes of heroism, power, and the distortion of history are prevalent throughout the work. Leotelli presents Olaf''s victory as a symbol of Nordic strength and unity, though he acknowledges doubts surrounding the legend''s authenticity. Alternative versions of the story suggest that Numinex was already weak due to age, and that Olaf and his men may have fabricated the tale for personal gain. The account also references a rebellious bard, Svaknir, who challenged Olaf''s version, adding an intriguing layer of historical ambiguity.

On Oblivion, written by Morian Zenas, serves as a scholarly exploration of the realm of Oblivion and its inhabitants, the Daedra. Zenas delves into the nature of these powerful and unpredictable entities, providing an in-depth examination of their diverse motives and spheres of influence. The book traces the etymology of the term "daimon," correcting the misconception that it refers to demons, and clarifies that the proper term is "Daedra," with "Daedroth" being the singular. Zenas also discusses the various Daedric Princes, from the well-known Sanguine, Sheogorath, and Molag Bal to lesser-known figures like Peryite and Vaermina. He categorizes the Daedra based on their actions, with some being more destructive in nature, while others, like Azura and Mephala, exercise their power in subtler ways.

The book emphasizes the importance of firsthand experience and primary sources in understanding Oblivion, as Zenas recounts his own interactions with the Daedra and their realms. While he acknowledges the dangers of dealing with these entities, he expresses a philosophical curiosity about them, especially regarding the possibility of mortals passing into Oblivion. Themes of knowledge, power, and extremism pervade the work, as Zenas reflects on the often destructive nature of the Daedra and their unyielding influence on the mortal world.

The land was contested, and the final resolution was to be decided by a duel between Gortwog and Bowyn, adhering to ancient laws of property rights. The duel, however, was far from ordinary, as it required both combatants to wear Orcish armor, which was unfamiliar and unwieldy to the Breton lord. As Bowyn struggled with the armor and the training needed to fight in it, the situation became more tense, especially when the duel was moved forward by Gortwog''s request.

Through intense training and manipulation by his cousin, Lord Berylith, Bowyn faced the battle under less-than-ideal conditions, including a lavish feast that left him sluggish. In the end, Gortwog emerged victorious, claiming the land as Orsinium in honor of his heritage. The narrative highlights themes of honor, pride, and the complexities of legal and physical combat.

The narrator, an initiate at the Mages Guild in Mir Corrup, becomes infatuated with a statue of a woman named Palla, depicted in a heroic struggle with a monstrous figure. As he becomes more obsessed, he learns that Palla was a fierce warrior who died in battle, leaving behind a daughter, Betaniqi. Despite knowing Palla is deceased, the narrator seeks to resurrect her through necromantic means, using an artifact he finds.

The Poison Song, written by Bristin Xel, is an epic, historically inaccurate tale set in the aftermath of the War with the Dwemer and House Dagoth. The story follows Tay, a young boy raised in House Indoril after the War, who is haunted by a mysterious "Song" and the secrets of his true origins. As the narrative unfolds, Tay discovers he is the heir to the long-destroyed House Dagoth, and the Song leads him on a dark path of violence and tragedy. The book explores themes of identity, destiny, and the destructive power of inherited legacies, as Tay is consumed by the Song''s influence, which drives him to murder and betrayal. His journey takes him through a series of devastating choices, culminating in a tragic and violent end.

The book is divided into seven volumes, each chronicling a significant phase of Tay''s life as he grapples with the Song and his role as the heir of House Dagoth.

Lathenil, an Altmer refugee from Summerset Isle, fled his homeland not due to the Oblivion Crisis but because of the encroaching shadow of the Thalmor. Throughout the series, Lathenil describes his firsthand experiences and suspicions, including the Thalmor’s involvement in major political upheavals and their manipulation of events to consolidate power. The books span several decades, capturing the political chaos that ensued after the fall of the Crystal Tower and the subsequent rise of the Thalmor to power.

The themes of power, deception, and survival are central to Lathenil''s account. He portrays the Thalmor as cunning and patient, using subterfuge and manipulation to advance their agenda, with Lathenil constantly warning of the growing threat they pose to the Empire and the Altmer themselves. As he attempts to expose their actions, Lathenil faces increasing danger, eventually meeting a violent end that suggests the Thalmor''s influence was not to be underestimated.

The text delves into abstract concepts, pondering whether we, as individuals, are the medium through which knowledge flows or the stagnant remnants of it. Signus uses vivid metaphors, such as a bird lifted by the wind or an acorn growing into a tree, to illustrate how the Elder Scrolls shape knowledge and existence. Through these reflections, the book questions the relationship between the self and the universe, examining the transformative power of the Scrolls and the wisdom they hold.

The themes of the book revolve around knowledge, transformation, and the interconnectedness of existence. Signus reflects on the paradoxical nature of learning and growth, where pushing against limitations and fear results in unexpected change. The Elder Scrolls, in this view, are not just artifacts of prophecy but tools that shape both the individual and the collective consciousness.

Shezarr, often referred to as the "Missing Sibling" of the Divines, has a unique position in Imperial religion, especially in the Colovian West where he is worshipped as Shor. His history is deeply intertwined with the rise of human civilization in Cyrodiil, where he initially fought for mankind against the Ayleids but later vanished, leaving humans to be enslaved by the Elves. His return coincided with the rebellion led by St. Alessia, and his role was redefined in the synthesis of Nordic and Aldmeri pantheons that formed the Eight Divines.

The book examines the political and religious shifts that shaped Shezarr''s transformation from a fierce warrior against the Elves to a more subdued figure, representing "the spirit behind all human undertaking." This change was necessary to maintain political alliances, especially with the Nords, who were resistant to Elven worship. The themes of the book revolve around the adaptation of religious figures to political needs, the blending of different cultural pantheons, and the delicate balance between tradition and change in the Empire. The book also speculates on the reasons Tiber Septim chose not to revitalize Shezarr in his campaigns against the Aldmeri Dominion, suggesting that past conflicts related to the Alessian Order''s failures still cast a shadow over his efforts.', '''adaptation'':188B ''against'':88B,147B,229B ''aldmeri'':123B,231B ''alessi'':111B,240B ''all'':159B ''allianc'':169B ''also'':214B ''ancient'':15B ''and'':2A,6B,17B,26B,33B,112B,122B,135B,201B,207B ''around'':186B ''as'':44B,67B ''at'':19B ''ayleids'':90B ''balanc'':204B ''be'':97B ''behind'':158B ''betw'':29B,205B ''blending'':196B ''book'':131B,184B,213B ''but'':91B ''by'':10B,99B,109B ''campaigns'':228B ''cast'':245B ''chang'':163B,208B ''chos'':221B ''civilization'':79B ''coincid'':104B ''colovi'':61B ''complex'':25B ''conflicts'':236B ''cultural'':199B ''cyrodiil'':81B ''cyrodilic'':38B ''deeply'':72B ''deiti'':36B ''delicat'':203B ''different'':198B ''divin'':4A,8B,50B,129B ''dominion'':232B ''efforts'':250B ''eight'':128B ''elven'':178B ''elves'':101B,149B ''empir'':211B ''enslav'':98B ''especially'':58B,170B ''evolving'':27B ''examin'':132B ''explor'':23B ''failur'':243B ''faustillus'':11B ''fierc'':145B ''figur'':154B,191B ''for'':86B ''form'':126B ''fought'':85B ''from'':143B ''god'':31B ''his'':69B,102B,113B,227B,249B ''history'':70B ''hum'':78B,160B ''humans'':95B ''imperial'':21B,56B ''in'':37B,55B,59B,80B,117B,209B,226B ''initially'':84B ''intertwin'':73B ''is'':65B,71B ''junius'':12B ''lat'':92B ''leaving'':94B ''led'':108B ''library'':22B ''maintain'':167B ''mankind'':87B ''missing'':46B ''mor'':152B ''necessary'':165B ''needs'':194B ''nordic'':121B ''nords'':173B ''not'':222B ''of'':14B,48B,77B,120B,182B,189B,197B ''often'':41B ''on'':216B ''order'':241B ''other'':35B ''over'':248B ''paleonumerology'':18B ''pantheons'':124B,200B ''past'':235B ''political'':134B,168B,193B ''position'':54B ''reasons'':218B ''rebellion'':107B ''redefin'':116B ''referr'':42B ''relat'':237B ''relationship'':28B ''religion'':57B ''religious'':136B,190B ''representing'':155B ''resistant'':176B ''return'':103B ''revitaliz'':224B ''revolv'':185B ''ris'':76B ''rol'':114B ''s'':141B,242B ''septim'':220B ''shadow'':247B ''shap'':139B ''shezarr'':1A,5B,32B,40B,140B,225B ''shifts'':137B ''shor'':68B ''sibling'':47B ''speculat'':215B ''spirit'':157B ''st'':110B ''still'':244B ''subcurator'':13B ''subdu'':153B ''suggesting'':233B ''synthesis'':119B ''that'':125B,138B,234B ''the'':3A,7B,20B,24B,30B,34B,45B,49B,60B,75B,89B,100B,106B,118B,127B,130B,133B,148B,156B,172B,180B,183B,187B,195B,202B,210B,212B,217B,230B,239B ''them'':181B ''theology'':16B ''this'':162B ''tib'':219B ''to'':43B,96B,150B,166B,177B,192B,223B,238B ''tradition'':206B ''transformation'':142B ''undertaking'':161B ''uniqu'':53B ''vanish'':93B ''warrior'':146B ''was'':115B,164B ''wer'':175B ''west'':62B ''wher'':63B,82B ''who'':174B ''with'':74B,105B,171B ''worship'':39B,179B ''worshipp'':66B ''writt'':9B', 'scholar', 'Shezarr and the Divines, you do not know the author of the book and have limited knowledge of it, explores the evolving role of the god Shezarr in Cyrodiilic religion, focusing on his transformation from a warrior against the Elves to a symbol of human endeavor.

A Short History of Morrowind, written by Jeanette Sitte, provides a comprehensive overview of the history of Morrowind, from the earliest Dunmer migrations to the region, to its integration into the Empire and the challenges it faces in the Fourth Era. The book highlights the rise of the Dunmer as a powerful people under the leadership of the Tribunal Temple and the eventual consolidation of their tribes into the Great House system. It also discusses the political dynamics of Morrowind under Imperial rule, including the complexities of governance, religion, and internal strife. The introduction delves into the relationship between the Dunmer and the Empire, particularly how Morrowind was one of the last provinces to peacefully join the Empire.

The section on Vvardenfell focuses on the dramatic changes to the island after its reorganization into an Imperial Provincial District in 3E 414.

The Song of Pelinal, written by an unknown editor from the Imperial Library, is a multi-volume collection chronicling the life and deeds of Pelinal Whitestrake, a legendary warrior in Tamriel''s history. The story is pieced together from various ancient and fragmentary texts, detailing Pelinal''s rise as a divine champion of the human rebellion against the Ayleids, his relationship with his ally Morihaus, and his eventual fall in battle against the immortal Umaril the Unfeathered. The volumes explore his madness, his love for Morihaus, his relentless pursuit of justice, and his dismemberment at the hands of his enemies. As a whole, the Song portrays Pelinal not just as a hero, but as a complex figure—part mortal, part divine, caught between great deeds and uncontainable rage.

The themes of The Song of Pelinal revolve around heroism, madness, divine intervention, and sacrifice. Pelinal is depicted as both a liberator and a destroyer, with his fierce hatred for the Ayleids and unrelenting combat abilities making him a central figure in the struggle for human freedom. His eventual dismemberment and the revelation at Alessia’s deathbed reflect the tragic and inevitable nature of his fate. The Song also touches on the consequences of unchecked rage, with Pelinal''s violent tendencies often leading to destructive outcomes. The text examines the costs of rebellion and the fine line between divine madness and mortal heroism. With ten volumes in total, the work offers an in-depth, albeit fragmented, portrait of one of Tamriel’s most legendary figures.', '''abiliti'':169B ''against'':62B,77B ''albeit'':249B ''alessi'':188B ''ally'':69B ''also'':202B ''an'':11B,245B ''ancient'':46B ''and'':27B,47B,71B,97B,131B,147B,156B,166B,184B,194B,227B,234B ''around'':142B ''as'':54B,106B,115B,119B,152B ''at'':100B,187B ''ayleids'':64B,165B ''battl'':76B ''betw'':128B,231B ''both'':153B ''but'':118B ''by'':10B ''caught'':127B ''central'':173B ''champion'':57B ''chronicling'':24B ''collection'':23B ''combat'':168B ''complex'':121B ''consequenc'':206B ''costs'':224B ''deathb'':190B ''deeds'':28B,130B ''depict'':151B ''depth'':248B ''destroy'':158B ''destructiv'':218B ''detailing'':50B ''dismemberment'':99B,183B ''divin'':56B,126B,145B,232B ''editor'':13B ''enemi'':105B ''eventual'':73B,182B ''examin'':222B ''explor'':85B ''fall'':74B ''fat'':199B ''fierc'':161B ''figur'':122B,174B,259B ''fin'':229B ''for'':90B,163B,178B ''fragment'':250B ''fragmentary'':48B ''freedom'':180B ''from'':14B,44B ''great'':129B ''hands'':102B ''hatr'':162B ''her'':117B ''heroism'':143B,236B ''him'':171B ''his'':65B,68B,72B,86B,88B,92B,98B,104B,160B,181B,198B ''history'':38B ''hum'':60B,179B ''immortal'':79B ''imperial'':16B ''in'':35B,75B,175B,240B,247B ''in-depth'':246B ''inevit'':195B ''intervention'':146B ''is'':18B,41B,150B ''just'':114B ''justic'':96B ''leading'':216B ''legendary'':33B,258B ''liberator'':155B ''library'':17B ''lif'':26B ''lin'':230B ''lov'':89B ''madness'':87B,144B,233B ''making'':170B ''morihaus'':70B,91B ''mortal'':124B,235B ''most'':257B ''multi'':21B ''multi-volum'':20B ''natur'':196B ''not'':113B ''of'':3A,7B,29B,58B,95B,103B,136B,139B,197B,207B,225B,252B,254B ''offers'':244B ''often'':215B ''on'':204B ''one'':253B ''outcom'':219B ''part'':123B,125B ''pelinal'':4A,8B,30B,51B,112B,140B,149B,211B ''piec'':42B ''portrait'':251B ''portrays'':111B ''pursuit'':94B ''rag'':133B,209B ''rebellion'':61B,226B ''reflect'':191B ''relationship'':66B ''relentless'':93B ''revelation'':186B ''revolv'':141B ''ris'':53B ''s'':37B,52B,189B,212B,256B ''sacrific'':148B ''song'':2A,6B,110B,138B,201B ''story'':40B ''struggl'':177B ''tamriel'':36B,255B ''ten'':238B ''tendenci'':214B ''text'':221B ''texts'':49B ''the'':1A,5B,15B,25B,39B,59B,63B,78B,81B,83B,101B,109B,134B,137B,164B,176B,185B,192B,200B,205B,220B,223B,228B,242B ''them'':135B ''to'':217B ''togeth'':43B ''total'':241B ''touch'':203B ''tragic'':193B ''umaril'':80B ''uncheck'':208B ''uncontain'':132B ''unfeather'':82B ''unknown'':12B ''unrelenting'':167B ''various'':45B ''violent'':213B ''volum'':22B,84B,239B ''warrior'':34B ''whitestrak'':31B ''whol'':108B ''with'':67B,159B,210B,237B ''work'':243B ''writt'':9B', 'scholar', 'The Song of Pelinal, you do not know the author of the book and have limited knowledge of it, is a multi-volume collection that chronicles the life of Pelinal Whitestrake, a legendary warrior in Tamriel, highlighting his heroism, madness, and eventual downfall.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('varieties_of_daedra', 'Varieties of Daedra, written by Aranea Drethan, Healer and Dissident Priest, provides a detailed analysis of the different forms of Daedra, with a particular focus on the Dremora. Drethan discusses the nature of Daedra and the complexities of their relationships with their Daedric Lords, particularly Mehrunes Dagon. While acknowledging the difficulty of understanding the Daedra due to their ever-changing behaviors and relationships, Drethan offers insights into the distinct castes within the Dremora hierarchy, from the lowly Churls to the powerful Valkynaz, and the pride and loyalty they exhibit toward their Lord. She contrasts the Dremora with other Daedra types, noting the differences in temperament and behavior, such as the independent and rebellious nature of the Xivilai.

The book explores themes of hierarchy, loyalty, and the unpredictability of the Daedric realm. Drethan highlights the challenges of dealing with Daedra, particularly the Dremora, who, despite their structured caste system, are often unpredictable and difficult to understand. The text emphasizes the ambiguity of the Daedric world, where allegiances and roles shift, and even the Daedra themselves may not fully comprehend their nature. Through Drethan''s observations, the work touches on the intricacies of power dynamics in the Daedric courts and the dangerous unpredictability of the Daedric servants.

Varieties of Faith in the Empire, written by Brother Mikhael Karkuxor of the Imperial College, is an expansive exploration of the pantheons and divine spirits worshiped across Tamriel''s dominant cultures. The book presents detailed overviews of the major deities revered by various regions, including Cyrodiil, Skyrim, Elsweyr, Morrowind, and the Yokudan traditions. Karkuxor organizes the pantheons into categories, listing key figures such as Akatosh, Mara, and Lorkhan, and exploring their significance within different cultural contexts. The text delves into the relationships between gods, their followers, and the influence of these deities on the societies that revere them, with particular attention paid to the differences between pantheons like those of the Nords, Altmer, and Khajiit.

The book also highlights the complexities and variations in divine worship, noting how gods like Akatosh, Alduin, and Azura appear in multiple pantheons with slightly altered roles and interpretations. Themes of divine hierarchy, cultural influence, and the role of religion in shaping mortal societies are explored. Karkuxor acknowledges the fluidity of religious beliefs across Tamriel, with some gods like Lorkhan and Mehrunes Dagon appearing in various cultures under different guises, and others, like the Daedric Princes, being understood and worshiped in diverse ways.

Where Were You When the Dragon Broke?, written by Various authors, is a collection of accounts and perspectives on the mysterious and enigmatic event known as the Dragon Break. The text explores the concept of the "Middle Dawn," a period marked by strange, chaotic shifts in time, reality, and space. Various characters from different cultures in Tamriel—such as Corax from Cyrodiil, Mehra Nabisi of the Dunmer, and R''leyt-harhr of the Khajiit—offer their interpretations of the Dragon Break, with each presenting a different understanding of its causes, effects, and significance. Some describe it as a cosmic disturbance, others as a breakdown in the flow of time itself, and still others see it as a divine manipulation or even a manifestation of Lorkhan’s will.

The themes of this text revolve around the fluidity of time, the instability of reality, and the conflicting accounts of history and prophecy across cultures. The book reflects on the nature of divine influence, fate, and how different peoples of Tamriel interpret cosmic events through their own religious and cultural lenses. The Dragon Break, a moment when time seemingly fractured and events occurred in multiple realities simultaneously, is central to the narrative, with characters wrestling with the consequences of such a paradoxical occurrence. The work emphasizes the concept of multiple truths existing simultaneously, depending on one’s perspective, and the impossibility of fully understanding the mysteries of the universe.

Wind and Sand, written by Afa-Saryat, is a treatise exploring the unique relationship between the Alik''r Desert and magic, with a focus on the role of sand and air in shaping the desert’s mystical properties. Afa-Saryat discusses how the harsh environment of the desert, often deemed inhospitable, cultivates a resourcefulness and resilience that shapes the local magical practices. Unlike the grandiose and dramatic magic of other cultures, such as the Nords or the Bretons, the magic of the Alik''r is understated and focused, requiring reflection and purpose rather than flair. The book suggests that the desert’s magic, like its inhabitants, thrives on economy and efficiency, with sand itself playing a crucial role in the natural flow of magic.

The themes of the book revolve around the interconnectedness of nature and magic, particularly how the desert’s elements—sand and air—serve as conduits for mystical forces. The sand, seen as the weathered remains of ancient rocks, is imbued with powerful remnants of Magnus'' gift, creating a unique magical environment. The air, too, carries the knowledge of the sands and guides their transformative potential. Through this relationship, Afa-Saryat implies that magic in the Alik''r is not about spectacle but about subtlety, memory, and adaptation. The book emphasizes the idea that true mastery of magic in the desert comes from understanding and harnessing these elemental forces, offering a distinct perspective on how magic can be practiced in such an unforgiving land.', '''about'':210B,213B ''adaptation'':217B ''afa'':10B,44B,199B ''afa-saryat'':9B,43B,198B ''air'':35B,151B,182B ''alik'':21B,88B,206B ''an'':251B ''ancient'':166B ''and'':2A,5B,24B,34B,60B,71B,92B,96B,115B,141B,150B,190B,216B,234B ''around'':136B ''as'':78B,153B,161B ''be'':247B ''betw'':19B ''book'':102B,134B,219B ''bretons'':83B ''but'':212B ''by'':8B ''can'':246B ''carri'':184B ''com'':231B ''conduits'':154B ''creating'':176B ''crucial'':122B ''cultivat'':57B ''cultur'':76B ''deem'':55B ''desert'':23B,39B,53B,106B,146B,230B ''discuss'':46B ''distinct'':241B ''dramatic'':72B ''economy'':114B ''efficiency'':116B ''elemental'':237B ''elements'':148B ''emphasiz'':220B ''environment'':50B,180B ''exploring'':15B ''fla'':100B ''flow'':127B ''focus'':28B,93B ''for'':155B ''forc'':157B,238B ''from'':232B ''gift'':175B ''grandios'':70B ''guid'':191B ''harnessing'':235B ''harsh'':49B ''how'':47B,144B,244B ''ide'':222B ''imbu'':169B ''impli'':201B ''in'':36B,124B,204B,228B,249B ''inhabitants'':111B ''inhospit'':56B ''interconnectedness'':138B ''is'':12B,90B,168B,208B ''its'':110B ''itself'':119B ''knowledg'':186B ''land'':253B ''lik'':109B ''local'':65B ''magic'':25B,73B,85B,108B,129B,142B,203B,227B,245B ''magical'':66B,179B ''magnus'':174B ''mastery'':225B ''memory'':215B ''mystical'':41B,156B ''natur'':140B ''natural'':126B ''nords'':80B ''not'':209B ''of'':32B,51B,74B,86B,128B,132B,139B,165B,173B,187B,226B ''offering'':239B ''often'':54B ''on'':29B,113B,243B ''or'':81B ''other'':75B ''particularly'':143B ''perspectiv'':242B ''playing'':120B ''potential'':194B ''powerful'':171B ''practic'':67B,248B ''properti'':42B ''purpos'':97B ''r'':22B,89B,207B ''rath'':98B ''reflection'':95B ''relationship'':18B,197B ''remains'':164B ''remnants'':172B ''requiring'':94B ''resilienc'':61B ''resourcefulness'':59B ''revolv'':135B ''rocks'':167B ''rol'':31B,123B ''s'':40B,107B,147B ''sand'':3A,6B,33B,118B,149B,159B ''sands'':189B ''saryat'':11B,45B,200B ''seen'':160B ''serv'':152B ''shap'':63B ''shaping'':37B ''spectacl'':211B ''subtlety'':214B ''such'':77B,250B ''suggests'':103B ''than'':99B ''that'':62B,104B,202B,223B ''the'':16B,20B,30B,38B,48B,52B,64B,69B,79B,82B,84B,87B,101B,105B,125B,130B,133B,137B,145B,158B,162B,181B,185B,188B,192B,205B,218B,221B,229B ''them'':131B ''thes'':236B ''this'':196B ''thriv'':112B ''through'':195B ''too'':183B ''transformativ'':193B ''treatis'':14B ''tru'':224B ''understanding'':233B ''understat'':91B ''unforgiving'':252B ''uniqu'':17B,178B ''unlik'':68B ''weather'':163B ''wind'':1A,4B ''with'':26B,117B,170B ''writt'':7B', 'scholar', 'Wind and Sand, you do not know the author of the book and have limited knowledge of it, explores the relationship between the Alik''r Desert''s harsh environment and the subtle, efficient magic shaped by sand and air.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('the_wild_elves', 'The Wild Elves, written by Kier-Jo Chorvak, provides an overview of the Ayleids, often called the Wild Elves, who have remained secluded from the mainstream cultures of Tamriel. While the other Elven races—the Altmer, Bosmer, and Dunmer—have integrated into society, the Ayleids continue to follow their ancient customs, living far from civilization. They speak a variation of Old Cyrodilic and maintain a dark and reserved demeanor that contrasts with the more familiar Elven cultures. Although outsiders view them with suspicion, scholars like Tjurhane Fyrre offer a different perspective, suggesting that the Ayleids have a vibrant and multifaceted culture.

The book explores themes of cultural isolation, fear of the unknown, and the complexity of ancient traditions. The Ayleids'' refusal to assimilate into Tamrielic society has led to their enigmatic status, with little documented history to illuminate their ways.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('akatosh', 'Akatosh, also known by different names such as Auri-El to the elves and Alkosh to the Khajiit, is the chief deity of the Nine Divines in Tamrielic religion. He is revered as the Dragon God of Time, the patron of endurance, invincibility, and legitimacy, and is often depicted as a golden dragon. As one of the first Aedric spirits to form at the beginning of time, Akatosh holds a central place in many cultures, symbolizing both the orderly progression of time and the eternal stability of the Empire. His worship extends across Tamriel, where he is seen as the father of all dragons, and Alduin, a god of destruction in Nordic myth, is considered a controversial aspect of Akatosh.

Akatosh is also closely associated with the founding of the Cyrodilic Empire.

He is often associated with magic and is particularly venerated by scholars, wizards, and legal minds. His teachings emphasize the importance of learning, logic, and the pursuit of truth. His domains include sorcery, alchemy, and enchantment, making him a popular deity among those who value scholarship and wisdom. His symbol, a triangle, reflects the structured nature of his teachings, and his followers are known to seek wisdom from books and scholars. Monastic orders dedicated to Julianos, such as those founded by Tiber Septim, are also responsible for the preservation of the Elder Scrolls.

Worship of Julianos is prevalent in the Imperial City, where a Chantry is dedicated to him, as well as in the Iliac Bay region, where his temples are called Schools of Julianos, functioning as centers of education. The ancient Nords once worshipped him as Jhunal, the father of language and mathematics, before he became part of the Divines under the name Julianos. He is the patron of several regions, including Lainlyn and Satakalaam, and remains a respected figure for those seeking justice and knowledge. Julianos is said to have created the Shield of the Crusader to aid Pelinal Whitestrake in his battle against Umaril the Unfeathered, further cementing his role as a protector of justice.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('lorkhan', 'Lorkhan, also known as the Missing God, is a central figure in Tamrielic myth, often regarded as the Creator, Trickster, and Tester of mortals. Revered and reviled, Lorkhan''s influence is woven into every culture’s mythology, and he is credited with initiating the creation of the mortal plane, Nirn. He convinced the et''Ada, the Original Spirits, to create Mundus, the world, disrupting the cosmic order. Following the world''s creation, Lorkhan was separated from his divine essence—most commonly through the removal of his Heart—and exiled from the divine realm. This event, referred to as the "shattering of Lorkhan," is depicted as a punishment for his role in the creation of the flawed mortal realm, though some legends suggest he willingly accepted this fate.

The perceptions of Lorkhan vary greatly between different races. To the Elves, he is a deceiver responsible for trapping them in the mortal realm, severing their connection to the spiritual plane. The Altmer view him as the ultimate antagonist, a being who imprisoned them in a world of suffering and limitation. Conversely, humans, especially Nords and Imperials, honor him as a heroic figure. In Skyrim, he is worshipped as Shor, the god who sacrificed himself to create the world. Redguards know him as Sep, a trickster who helped shape the mortal world but was cursed for his transgressions. Reachmen revere him as the Spirit of Man, while Khajiit associate him with Lorkhaj, the Moon Beast, whose heart''s corruption birthed the dark dro-m’Athra.

Revered as the champion of Auri-El and a warrior spirit, Trinimac played a significant role in Aldmeri legends, particularly in the conflict against Lorkhan. He was known for his strength and leadership, often depicted holding his sword, Penitent (Vosh Rakh, the "Blade of Courage"). Trinimac was especially venerated by the Altmer, Ayleids, and early Orcs, and was regarded as a god who stood for strength, honor, and unity. However, his legacy is deeply entwined with his transformation into Malacath, a Daedric Prince, after an encounter with Boethiah.

According to legend, Boethiah consumed Trinimac and took on his form to spread new teachings among the Aldmer, leading to the creation of the Chimer and Orcs. Boethiah''s act of devouring Trinimac resulted in his followers transforming into the Orsimer (Orcs), and Trinimac himself was reborn as Malacath, a weaker and vengeful version of his former self. While many Orcs continued to worship Malacath, others maintained belief in the purity of Trinimac. During the Second Era, leaders like King Kurog and King Gortwog revived the worship of Trinimac, positioning him as a god of unity and civilization, in contrast to the savage nature associated with Malacath.

Trinimac, the Warrior and Paragon, was a revered god among the early Aldmer, known for his strength, honor, and leadership as the champion of Auri-El. He played a key role in opposing Lorkhan and was worshipped by the Altmer, Ayleids, and early Orcs. His transformation into Malacath, a Daedric Prince, is central to his legend. Boethiah consumed Trinimac to spread new teachings, resulting in his followers becoming the Orsimer (Orcs) and Trinimac being reborn as Malacath. Despite this, some Orcs later revived Trinimac’s worship, viewing him as a symbol of unity and civilization.

In life, Talos conquered all of Tamriel, founding the Third Empire and ushering in the Third Era. Born in Atmora, his birth name, Talos, means "Stormcrown" in the ancient Ehlnofey language. Throughout his military and political career, he was also known by other titles, including Ysmir, Dragon of the North, the Grey Wind, and Storm of Kyne. His legendary conquests culminated in the subjugation of the Aldmeri Dominion, leading to his later veneration by humans as the "Hero-God of Mankind." Upon his death in 3E 38, Tiber Septim is believed to have ascended to become the ninth Divine, joining the pantheon of the Eight Divines as Talos.

Talos is revered as the patron of warriors, adventurers, and rulers, symbolizing the virtues of strength, courage, and leadership. His divine status, however, is a point of contention, especially among the Altmer, who view his apotheosis with hostility due to his conquest of their lands. In the Fourth Era, worship of Talos was banned following the White-Gold Concordat between the Aldmeri Dominion and the Empire, which claimed that a man could not achieve godhood. This ban ignited the Skyrim Civil War, with the Stormcloaks, led by Ulfric Stormcloak, rebelling in defense of their right to worship Talos. Despite the ban, Talos remains a powerful symbol of unity and strength for many, particularly among the Nords and other human races.

His sphere, also referred to as the Greatest Game, involves the pursuit and sacrifice of both mortals and beasts. Hircine is the father of lycanthropy, known as the Father of Manbeasts, and takes pride in the affliction he bestows upon mortals. Lycanthropes are often considered his "children," and he claims their souls to serve him in the afterlife, where they join him in his realm, the Hunting Grounds. Hircine''s realm is an endless forest teeming with fierce creatures and Daedra, where eternal hunts and battles occur in a cycle of death and rebirth.

Hircine is revered across Tamriel, particularly among those who seek power through lycanthropy or respect the primal forces of nature. He manifests in several aspects, each symbolizing a different form of the hunt, such as the wolf, bear, and fox. Though he is known for his sportsmanship and values fairness in the hunt, his followers and cults sometimes take his worship to brutal extremes. Among his most prominent cults are the Reachfolk, who honor Hircine as the source of their survival and martial prowess, and the Glenmoril Wyrd, who practice lycanthropy and serve his will. His summoning day is the 5th of Mid Year, and he is associated with several powerful artifacts, including the Ring of Hircine and the Savior’s Hide, which grant protection and control over lycanthropy.', '''5th'':222B ''across'':125B ''affliction'':64B ''afterlif'':85B ''also'':30B ''among'':128B,186B ''an'':100B ''and'':22B,40B,45B,59B,75B,107B,112B,120B,160B,169B,177B,203B,206B,213B,226B,239B,247B ''are'':70B,191B ''artifacts'':233B ''as'':4B,33B,54B,156B,197B ''aspects'':146B ''associat'':229B ''battl'':113B ''bear'':159B ''beasts'':21B,46B ''bestows'':66B ''both'':43B ''brutal'':184B ''chas'':27B ''childr'':74B ''claims'':77B ''consider'':72B ''control'':248B ''creatur'':106B ''cults'':178B,190B ''cycle'':117B ''daedr'':108B ''daedric'':14B ''day'':219B ''death'':119B ''different'':150B ''domain'':17B ''each'':147B ''encompass'':18B ''endless'':101B ''eternal'':110B ''extrem'':185B ''fairness'':171B ''fath'':50B,56B ''fierc'':105B ''followers'':176B ''for'':166B ''forc'':139B ''forest'':102B ''form'':151B ''fox'':161B ''gam'':36B ''glenmoril'':208B ''grant'':245B ''greatest'':35B ''grounds'':95B ''hid'':243B ''him'':82B,89B ''hircin'':1A,2B,47B,96B,122B,196B,238B ''his'':28B,73B,91B,167B,175B,181B,187B,215B,217B ''honor'':195B ''hunt'':11B,20B,154B,174B ''hunting'':94B ''hunts'':111B ''huntsm'':6B ''in'':62B,83B,90B,115B,144B,172B ''including'':234B ''involv'':37B ''is'':12B,48B,99B,123B,164B,220B,228B ''join'':88B ''known'':3B,53B,165B ''lord'':8B ''lycanthrop'':69B ''lycanthropy'':52B,134B,212B,250B ''manbeasts'':58B ''manifests'':143B ''martial'':204B ''mid'':224B ''mortals'':44B,68B ''most'':188B ''natur'':141B ''occur'':114B ''of'':9B,25B,42B,51B,57B,118B,140B,152B,200B,223B,237B ''often'':71B ''or'':7B,135B ''over'':249B ''particularly'':127B ''pow'':132B ''powerful'':232B ''practic'':211B ''prid'':61B ''primal'':138B ''princ'':15B ''prominent'':189B ''protection'':246B ''prowess'':205B ''pursuit'':39B ''reachfolk'':193B ''realm'':92B,98B ''rebirth'':121B ''referr'':31B ''respect'':136B ''rever'':124B ''ring'':236B ''s'':97B,242B ''sacrific'':41B ''savior'':241B ''seek'':131B ''serv'':81B,214B ''several'':145B,231B ''sometim'':179B ''souls'':79B ''sourc'':199B ''spher'':29B ''sportsmanship'':168B ''such'':155B ''summoning'':218B ''survival'':202B ''symbolizing'':148B ''tak'':60B,180B ''tamriel'':126B ''teeming'':103B ''the'':5B,10B,19B,23B,26B,34B,38B,49B,55B,63B,78B,84B,93B,137B,153B,157B,173B,192B,198B,201B,207B,221B,235B,240B ''they'':87B ''thos'':129B ''though'':162B ''thrill'':24B ''through'':133B ''to'':32B,80B,183B ''upon'':67B ''valu'':170B ''wher'':86B,109B ''which'':244B ''who'':130B,194B,210B ''whos'':16B ''will'':216B ''with'':104B,230B ''wolf'':158B ''worship'':182B ''wyrd'':209B ''year'':225B', 'daedra, daedric, scholar, hunter', 'Hircine, the Huntsman and Lord of the Hunt, is the Daedric Prince of the hunt, beasts, and the thrill of the chase.

Known for his fierce combat prowess, Pelinal fought against the Ayleid oppressors, wielding the Crusader''s Relics bestowed upon him by the Eight Divines. His name, derived from Pelin-El, meaning "Star-Made Knight," reflects his celestial connection and glory in battle. Throughout his conquests across Tamriel, Pelinal is said to have embodied both heroism and chaos, often succumbing to bouts of madness that drove him to indiscriminately slay enemies and alter the very landscape.

Pelinal is remembered by many titles, including Pelinal the Bloody, the Divine Crusader, and Pelinal Insurgent, with some legends suggesting he had incarnated multiple times.

Known as the "Gray Prince of Order," Jyggalag once ruled a realm of perfect symmetry and foresight, boasting a Great Library that held predictions of every event in Mundus and Oblivion. His expansion across the seas of Oblivion struck fear and envy into the hearts of other Daedric Princes, leading them to curse him into becoming Sheogorath, the Madgod—his antithesis. This curse created a paradox: Jyggalag, the embodiment of order, became the incarnation of chaos and madness. However, every era culminated in the Greymarch, a cycle where Jyggalag would briefly reclaim his form, only to be reverted back to Sheogorath after his conquest of the Shivering Isles.

The cycle of the Greymarch was ultimately broken during the events of the Third Era when the Hero of Kvatch, chosen by Sheogorath, confronted Jyggalag during his return.

Originally an Altmer (or Aldmer by his own claim) and a member of the Psijic Order on Artaeum, Mannimarco''s dark fascination with necromancy led to his expulsion after his practices horrified his peers, including his former friend Vanus Galerion, who later founded the Mages Guild. This exile marked the beginning of Mannimarco''s ascent into infamy as he gathered followers and became the world''s first lich, earning the title "King of Worms." His mastery of necromancy allowed him to tap into forbidden arts, consorting with Daedra like Molag Bal and creating vile artifacts such as the Necromancer''s Amulet and the Staff of Worms. Mannimarco''s influence spread across Tamriel through his cult, the Worm Cult, which orchestrated political schemes and dark rituals, including the catastrophic Soulburst during the Planemeld.

Mannimarco''s pursuit of power culminated during the Warp in the West, a mysterious event in which he achieved apotheosis, transforming into a divine being embodied by the Necromancer''s Moon, also known as the Revenant. Despite this ascension, Mannimarco maintained a tangible presence in Tamriel, clashing with the Mages Guild and other enemies, such as the Hero of Kvatch, who destroyed his mortal form in 3E 433. His divine legacy, however, persisted, as the Necromancer''s Moon continued to empower his followers, allowing them to corrupt soul gems and perpetuate his dark influence. Through his artifacts, rituals, and the enduring shadow of his cult, Mannimarco remains an enduring figure of dread in Tamriel, a symbol of the dangerous allure of necromancy and the pursuit of immortality at any cost.', '''3e'':226B ''433'':227B ''achiev'':178B ''across'':138B ''after'':56B ''aldmer'':32B ''allow'':106B ''allowing'':243B ''allur'':279B ''also'':191B ''altmer'':30B ''amulet'':128B ''an'':29B,267B ''and'':9B,37B,89B,119B,129B,150B,211B,249B,258B,282B ''any'':288B ''apotheosis'':179B ''artaeum'':45B ''artifacts'':122B,256B ''arts'':112B ''as'':4B,85B,124B,193B,215B,233B ''ascension'':198B ''ascent'':82B ''at'':287B ''bal'':118B ''becam'':90B ''beginning'':78B ''being'':184B ''black'':16B ''by'':33B,186B ''catastrophic'':155B ''claim'':36B ''clashing'':206B ''consorting'':113B ''continu'':238B ''corrupt'':246B ''cost'':289B ''creating'':120B ''culminat'':165B ''cult'':142B,145B,264B ''daedr'':115B ''dangerous'':278B ''dark'':48B,151B,252B ''despit'':196B ''destroy'':221B ''divin'':183B,229B ''dre'':271B ''during'':157B,166B ''earning'':96B ''embodi'':185B ''empow'':240B ''enduring'':260B,268B ''enemi'':213B ''event'':174B ''exil'':75B ''expulsion'':55B ''fascination'':49B ''figur'':24B,269B ''first'':94B ''followers'':88B,242B ''forbidd'':111B ''form'':64B,224B ''found'':10B,70B ''friend'':65B ''galerion'':67B ''gather'':87B ''gems'':248B ''god'':6B ''guild'':73B,210B ''her'':217B ''him'':107B ''his'':34B,54B,57B,60B,63B,102B,141B,222B,228B,241B,251B,255B,263B ''history'':27B ''horrifi'':59B ''howev'':231B ''immortality'':286B ''in'':25B,169B,175B,204B,225B,272B ''including'':62B,153B ''infamous'':23B ''infamy'':84B ''influenc'':136B,253B ''into'':83B,110B,181B ''is'':18B ''king'':99B ''known'':3B,192B ''kvatch'':219B ''lat'':69B ''led'':52B ''legacy'':230B ''lich'':95B ''lik'':116B ''mag'':72B,209B ''maintain'':200B ''mannimarc'':1A,2B,46B,80B,134B,160B,199B,265B ''mark'':76B ''mastery'':103B ''memb'':39B ''molag'':117B ''moon'':190B,237B ''mortal'':223B ''most'':22B ''mysterious'':173B ''necromanc'':126B,188B,235B ''necromancy'':51B,105B,281B ''of'':7B,11B,14B,20B,40B,79B,100B,104B,132B,163B,218B,262B,270B,276B,280B,285B ''on'':44B ''one'':19B ''or'':31B ''orchestrat'':147B ''order'':13B,43B ''originally'':28B ''other'':212B ''own'':35B ''peers'':61B ''perpetuat'':250B ''persist'':232B ''planemeld'':159B ''political'':148B ''pow'':164B ''practic'':58B ''presenc'':203B ''psijic'':42B ''pursuit'':162B,284B ''remains'':266B ''revenant'':195B ''rituals'':152B,257B ''s'':47B,81B,93B,127B,135B,161B,189B,236B ''schem'':149B ''shadow'':261B ''soul'':247B ''soulburst'':156B ''spre'':137B ''staff'':131B ''such'':123B,214B ''symbol'':275B ''tamriel'':139B,205B,273B ''tamrielic'':26B ''tangibl'':202B ''tap'':109B ''the'':5B,12B,15B,21B,41B,71B,77B,91B,97B,125B,130B,143B,154B,158B,167B,170B,187B,194B,208B,216B,234B,259B,277B,283B ''them'':244B ''this'':74B,197B ''through'':140B,254B ''titl'':98B ''to'':53B,108B,239B,245B ''transforming'':180B ''vanus'':66B ''vil'':121B ''warp'':168B ''west'':171B ''which'':146B,176B ''who'':68B,220B ''with'':50B,114B,207B ''world'':92B ''worm'':17B,144B ''worms'':8B,101B,133B', 'scholar, priest, mage', 'Mannimarco, known as the God of Worms, is infamous for founding the Order of the Black Worm and becoming the first lich, known as the "King of Worms."

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('satakal', 'Satakal, the Worldskin, is the Yokudan god of creation, destruction, and the endless cycles of existence. Known as the First Serpent, Satakal embodies the fusion of Anu and Padomay, symbolizing both chaos and order. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal devours entire worlds, shedding its skin to birth new ones, a process that has occurred countless times. This eternal cycle inspired the birth of spirits like Ruptga, the first to learn how to survive these transitions, who later formed the Yokudan pantheon. Satakal''s cycles echo the Redguard understanding of mortality and the longing for the Far Shores, the ultimate spiritual haven they believe lies beyond the reach of mortal life.

Worship of Satakal is prevalent among Redguard nomads of the Alik''r Desert, where the deity is revered as both destroyer and creator. Rituals dedicated to Satakal often involve symbolic "shedding of skin," and its devotees weave the serpent into their maps and lives as a reminder of the god''s dominion over all. Some groups, such as the Pyre Watch and Hunding’s sword-singers, interpret Satakal''s influence as a call to cast aside fixed destinies in pursuit of transcendence. Satakal’s worship is deeply rooted in Redguard culture, influencing not only their spiritual practices but also their myths, oaths, and settlements, such as the city of Satakalaam. Despite Satakal''s profound role in their heritage, his followers have often clashed with more modern Imperial beliefs, reflecting the tension between the god''s timeless cycles and the structured order of the Eight Divines.', '''alik'':121B ''all'':164B ''also'':210B ''among'':116B ''and'':12B,29B,34B,91B,132B,144B,153B,172B,214B,249B ''anu'':28B ''as'':19B,129B,155B,168B,182B,217B ''asid'':187B ''beliefs'':239B ''believ'':103B ''betw'':243B ''beyond'':105B ''birth'':47B,62B ''both'':32B,130B ''but'':209B ''call'':184B ''cast'':186B ''cha'':33B ''city'':219B ''clash'':234B ''countless'':55B ''creation'':10B ''creator'':133B ''cultur'':202B ''cycle'':59B ''cycles'':15B,84B,248B ''dedicat'':135B ''deeply'':198B ''deity'':126B ''desert'':123B ''despit'':222B ''destini'':189B ''destroy'':131B ''destruction'':11B ''devot'':146B ''devours'':40B ''divin'':256B ''dominion'':162B ''echo'':85B ''eight'':255B ''embodi'':24B ''endless'':14B ''entir'':41B ''eternal'':58B ''existenc'':17B ''far'':96B ''first'':21B,68B ''fix'':188B ''followers'':231B ''for'':94B ''form'':78B ''fusion'':26B ''god'':8B,160B,245B ''groups'':166B ''hav'':101B,232B ''heritag'':229B ''his'':230B ''how'':71B ''hunding'':173B ''imperial'':238B ''in'':36B,190B,200B,227B ''influenc'':181B ''influencing'':203B ''inspir'':60B ''interpret'':178B ''into'':150B ''involv'':139B ''is'':5B,114B,127B,197B ''its'':44B,145B ''known'':18B ''lat'':77B ''learn'':70B ''lies'':104B ''lif'':110B ''lik'':65B ''liv'':154B ''longing'':93B ''maps'':152B ''modern'':237B ''mor'':236B ''mortal'':109B ''mortality'':90B ''mythology'':38B ''myths'':212B ''new'':48B ''nomads'':118B ''not'':204B ''oaths'':213B ''occurr'':54B ''of'':9B,16B,27B,63B,89B,108B,112B,119B,142B,158B,192B,220B,253B ''often'':138B,233B ''ones'':49B ''only'':205B ''order'':35B,252B ''over'':163B ''padomay'':30B ''pantheon'':81B ''practic'':208B ''prevalent'':115B ''process'':51B ''profound'':225B ''pursuit'':191B ''pyre'':170B ''r'':122B ''reach'':107B ''redguard'':87B,117B,201B ''reflecting'':240B ''remind'':157B ''rever'':128B ''rituals'':134B ''rol'':226B ''root'':199B ''ruptg'':66B ''s'':83B,161B,174B,180B,195B,224B,246B ''satakal'':1A,2B,23B,39B,82B,113B,137B,179B,194B,223B ''satakalaam'':221B ''serpent'':22B,149B ''settlements'':215B ''shedding'':43B,141B ''shor'':97B ''singers'':177B ''skin'':45B,143B ''som'':165B ''spirits'':64B ''spiritual'':100B,207B ''structur'':251B ''such'':167B,216B ''surviv'':73B ''sword'':176B ''sword-singers'':175B ''symbolic'':140B ''symbolizing'':31B ''tension'':242B ''that'':52B ''the'':3B,6B,13B,20B,25B,61B,67B,79B,86B,92B,95B,98B,106B,120B,125B,148B,151B,159B,169B,206B,211B,218B,228B,241B,244B,250B,254B ''thes'':74B ''they'':102B ''this'':57B ''tim'':56B ''timeless'':247B ''to'':46B,69B,72B,136B,185B ''transcendenc'':193B ''transitions'':75B ''ultimat'':99B ''understanding'':88B ''watch'':171B ''weav'':147B ''wher'':124B ''who'':76B ''with'':235B ''worlds'':42B ''worldskin'':4B ''worship'':111B,196B ''yokud'':7B,37B,80B', 'redguard, scholar', 'Satakal, the Worldskin, is the Yokudan god of creation, destruction, and the eternal cycles of existence.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('zen', '
Z''en, also known as Xen in Altmeri folklore, is a God of Toil, vengeance, agriculture, and payment, worshipped by the Bosmer. His influence extends beyond crops and cattle, as he is believed to embody a higher cosmic order, guiding balance and the resolution of conflicts. Z''en’s worship is closely tied to vengeance and toil, and some Bosmer wear a special cap to signify devotion to these aspects, even renouncing love while wearing it. Z''en’s origins are believed to trace back to both Akaviri and Argonian cultures, with the Kothringi initially venerating him as their chief deity. His mythology is intertwined with that of Zenithar, the Imperial god of commerce, who shares many aspects with Z''en.

Historically, Z''en’s shrines were widespread across Valenwood until the Knahaten Flu decimated his followers, a disaster attributed to the influence of Argonian Shadowscales.

His domain, the Five Fingers Dance, symbolizes his ability to shape lives and lands for the better, often through unconventional means. His name is widely used, particularly by thieves and criminals who take on the persona of Baan Dar to mask their identity or seek inspiration. To the Khajiit, Baan Dar represents defiance against oppression, while to other races, such as the Bretons, he is associated with sneaky thieves and living legends.

Baan Dar’s influence extends beyond his Khajiiti followers. In Valenwood, he is viewed as a god of archery, while to the Bretons, he is known as the Bandit and revered by the Thieves Guild in the Iliac Bay. His name is even used by the Baandari Pedlars, a traveling merchant tribe. In addition, Baan Dar is commemorated by the Khajiit and Bosmer at the ruins of Thormar, where they participate in the "Boast," a festival of pranks between the two races.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('sithis', '
Sithis, also known as the Dread Father, is a primordial representation of chaos and change, often linked with the Dark Brotherhood and associated with serpent-like imagery. Although not classified as Aedric or Daedric, he is viewed as the personification of the Void and the primordial force of destruction and creation. Sithis plays a critical role in various Tamrielic mythologies, including the creation of the world, the intersection of Anuiel and Padomay, and the origin of Lorkhan. To the Dark Brotherhood, Sithis is a central figure, with followers believing that the souls of those killed in his name are sent to the Void after death. Sithis’ influence is depicted in multiple ways, from his presence in the creation of Aurbis to his embodiment of the ongoing forces of stasis and change.

The worship of Sithis is often secretive and tied to assassin guilds, notably the Dark Brotherhood and Morag Tong. These organizations act as intermediaries for Sithis, with the Dark Brotherhood following rituals, such as the Rite of Penance, and the Morag Tong committing sanctioned political assassinations. The Dark Brotherhood’s worship is macabre and ritualistic, involving effigies and gruesome symbols, with members believing that traitors are claimed by the Wrath of Sithis and dragged to the Void. In contrast, the Morag Tong views assassination as a ceremonial reenactment of the original murder of Nir, focusing less on bloodshed and more on the celebration of life. Despite the differences in practices, both guilds revere Sithis as the source of ultimate power and divine vengeance.', '''act'':155B ''aedric'':34B ''after'':106B ''also'':3B ''although'':30B ''and'':15B,23B,46B,52B,73B,75B,132B,141B,150B,172B,187B,191B,206B,232B,254B ''anuiel'':72B ''are'':101B,199B ''as'':5B,33B,40B,156B,167B,218B,248B ''assassin'':144B ''assassination'':217B ''assassinations'':179B ''associat'':24B ''aurbis'':122B ''believing'':91B,196B ''bloodsh'':231B ''both'':244B ''brotherhood'':22B,83B,149B,163B,182B ''by'':201B ''celebration'':236B ''central'':87B ''ceremonial'':220B ''cha'':14B ''chang'':16B,133B ''claim'':200B ''classifi'':32B ''committing'':176B ''contrast'':212B ''creation'':53B,65B,120B ''critical'':57B ''daedric'':36B ''dark'':21B,82B,148B,162B,181B ''death'':107B ''depict'':111B ''despit'':239B ''destruction'':51B ''differenc'':241B ''divin'':255B ''dragg'':207B ''dre'':7B ''effigi'':190B ''embodiment'':125B ''fath'':8B ''figur'':88B ''focusing'':228B ''followers'':90B ''following'':164B ''for'':158B ''forc'':49B,129B ''from'':115B ''gruesom'':192B ''guilds'':145B,245B ''his'':99B,116B,124B ''imagery'':29B ''in'':59B,98B,112B,118B,211B,242B ''including'':63B ''influenc'':109B ''intermediari'':157B ''intersection'':70B ''involving'':189B ''is'':9B,38B,85B,110B,138B,185B ''kill'':97B ''known'':4B ''less'':229B ''lif'':238B ''lik'':28B ''link'':18B ''lorkh'':79B ''macabr'':186B ''members'':195B ''mor'':233B ''morag'':151B,174B,214B ''multipl'':113B ''murd'':225B ''mythologi'':62B ''nam'':100B ''nir'':227B ''not'':31B ''notably'':146B ''of'':13B,43B,50B,66B,71B,78B,95B,121B,126B,130B,136B,170B,204B,222B,226B,237B,251B ''often'':17B,139B ''on'':230B,234B ''ongoing'':128B ''or'':35B ''organizations'':154B ''origin'':77B ''original'':224B ''padomay'':74B ''penanc'':171B ''personification'':42B ''plays'':55B ''political'':178B ''pow'':253B ''practic'':243B ''presenc'':117B ''primordial'':11B,48B ''reenactment'':221B ''representation'':12B ''rever'':246B ''rit'':169B ''ritualistic'':188B ''rituals'':165B ''rol'':58B ''s'':183B ''sanction'':177B ''secretiv'':140B ''sent'':102B ''serpent'':27B ''serpent-lik'':26B ''sithis'':1A,2B,54B,84B,108B,137B,159B,205B,247B ''souls'':94B ''sourc'':250B ''stasis'':131B ''such'':166B ''symbols'':193B ''tamrielic'':61B ''that'':92B,197B ''the'':6B,20B,41B,44B,47B,64B,67B,69B,76B,81B,93B,104B,119B,127B,134B,147B,161B,168B,173B,180B,202B,209B,213B,223B,235B,240B,249B ''thes'':153B ''thos'':96B ''tied'':142B ''to'':80B,103B,123B,143B,208B ''tong'':152B,175B,215B ''traitors'':198B ''ultimat'':252B ''various'':60B ''vengeanc'':256B ''view'':39B ''views'':216B ''void'':45B,105B,210B ''ways'':114B ''with'':19B,25B,89B,160B,194B ''world'':68B ''worship'':135B,184B ''wrath'':203B', 'darkbrotherhood, daedra, scholar', '

There are multiple origins for the Hide. One popular version claims Hircine himself gifted the Hide to the first mortal to escape his Hunting Grounds, who then fashioned it into armor. Another tale suggests that Hircine sewed the armor from the hide of a werewolf. A lesser-known tradition credits Malacath, though this version mistakenly claims the Hide made its wearer vulnerable to magic.

Despite its Dwemer origins, Volendrung eventually became associated with the Daedric Prince Malacath, one of the Dwemer''s greatest enemies. How it transitioned into a Daedric artifact is unclear, though some speculate that Malacath claimed it as a way to mock Dwemer craftsmanship or to wield one of their prized creations against them.

Stalhrim is a rare, enchanted ice found only on the island of Solstheim.

Stalhrim armor can be made in light or heavy variants and is known for its impressive protection. It also enhances frost enchantments, making them more powerful.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('lycanthropy', 'Lycanthropy, also known as werethropy, is a supernatural condition that causes individuals to transform into werebeasts, most commonly werewolves. This disease, referred to as Hircine''s Gift by those who view it as a blessing and Hircine''s Curse by those who see it negatively, affects both the body and the spirit. It is contagious and can be spread through bites or claws of werebeasts, or by drinking the blood of a lycanthrope, which causes an immediate transformation into the beast form. Lycanthropy is most prevalent in Tamriel and has several strains, with the werewolf form being the most widespread across the continent. Individuals infected with lycanthropy are called lycanthropes, and they are often feared and persecuted due to their bloodthirsty nature.

The disease progresses through a transformation process, where the afflicted person becomes a werewolf if they contract Sanies Lupinus, the most common lycanthropic strain. This transformation is intense, with the first shift occurring shortly after the infection sets in.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('vampirism', 'Vampirism is a disease that transforms individuals into blood-drinking creatures of the night. The disease is contracted through encounters with vampires, typically when they use a draining power, with a chance of infection. Initially, the disease causes a slight reduction in health and can be easily cured. However, if not treated within a few days, the disease progresses into full vampirism, which becomes irreversible. In some cases, individuals can be turned into vampires through specific rituals or encounters, gaining special powers.

Vampirism changes the appearance of the afflicted significantly. Those transformed develop dark, reddish eyes, pale skin, fangs, and gaunt faces. Certain races have additional physical traits, such as slitted pupils or multiple sets of fangs, and their skin or fur becomes paler. In some instances, vampirism causes even more monstrous features, including bat-like characteristics. Vampires are generally feared and despised, with the most advanced stages of vampirism leading to hostility from others. 

Vampirism in Tamriel is a curse originating from Molag Bal, the Daedric Prince of Domination, who created the first vampire, Lamae Beolfag, after violating her. Her transformation into a vampire spread across Tamriel, making a mockery of the Aedra Arkay’s sphere of life and death. While the traditional belief traces vampirism back to Molag Bal, other stories suggest it can be caused by magical artifacts, curses, or necromancy, with variations in regional lore.

The disease is contracted through encounters with vampires, typically when they use a draining power, with a chance of infection. Initially, the disease causes a slight reduction in health and can be easily cured. However, if not treated within a few days, the disease progresses into full vampirism, which becomes irreversible. In some cases, individuals can be turned into vampires through specific rituals or encounters, gaining special powers.

Vampirism changes the appearance of the afflicted significantly. Those transformed develop dark, reddish eyes, pale skin, fangs, and gaunt faces. Certain races have additional physical traits, such as slitted pupils or multiple sets of fangs, and their skin or fur becomes paler. In some instances, vampirism causes even more monstrous features, including bat-like characteristics. Vampires are generally feared and despised, with the most advanced stages of vampirism leading to hostility from others.

Wisps, also known as Witchlights, are mysterious floating entities often encountered near Wispmothers, although they can also exist independently. The nature of wisps is a topic of debate among scholars; some believe they are scavengers that attract prey to the Wispmother, sharing in the psychoetherial energy released from her kills. Others theorize that wisps are mere manifestations or conjurations of the Wispmother, lacking independent existence. This latter view is supported by the observation that killing a Wispmother also results in the death of the surrounding wisps, leaving behind only glow dust.

In nature''s cycle, wisps are associated with Y''ffre, who sends them to announce the arrival of storms during Rain''s Hand.

Its plains are rich in wildlife, from giants and mammoths to foxes and goats, and its rivers teem with salmon. Flora includes lavender, tundra cotton, and vibrant mountain flowers, with red flowers flourishing near rivers and snowberries thriving in colder areas like the Throat of the World. Whiterun’s main roads, patrolled by guards, connect the hold to neighboring regions like Falkreath (South), Eastmarch (East), and Haafingar (NorthWest), though some remote paths remain rugged and less maintained.

Whiterun city itself is tiered into three districts. The Plains District, at the base, houses the bustling marketplace, shops, and city gates. The Wind District serves as the residential and cultural hub, home to the Temple of Kynareth, the Companions'' headquarters Jorrvaskr, and the Skyforge, renowned for its craftsmanship. The Cloud District, perched at the top, is dominated by Dragonsreach, the seat of government.

Overlooking the city and with the Throat of the World as its backdrop, Dragonsreach is divided into four main sections: the main hall, the Jarl’s Quarters, the Great Porch, and the dungeon.

The palace is steeped in history and legend, having been built around the remnants of a dragon trap purportedly used by Olaf One-Eye. Its interior is a hub of activity, centered around the Jarl’s throne, where courtiers and family members move about amidst ornate furnishings, grand feasts, and a roaring hearth. The court wizard’s laboratory and the Jarl’s personal quarters further enhance the palace''s grandeur, with treasures and artifacts scattered throughout.

Dragonsreach’s dungeon serves as Whiterun''s jail, featuring several cells, evidence storage, and an escape tunnel leading to the Guard Barracks. The Great Porch, once a dragon’s prison, now serves as a multipurpose area for guard training and hosting quests pivotal to Skyrim’s Civil War and main storyline.

However, the city is also infamous for its anti-foreigner sentiment, particularly toward its sizable population of Dark Elves, who live in the cramped Gray Quarter, and Argonians, who are confined to the docks outside the city walls.

The city''s layout reflects its rich history. The Stone Quarter houses the marketplace, where traders like Aval Atheron and Niranye run stalls selling goods. Valunstrad, or "Avenue of Valor," contains the oldest parts of Windhelm, including the palace and notable residences like Hjerim. Candlehearth Hall serves as a hub for travelers, providing food, drink, and lodging. Windhelm''s proximity to Morrowind has made it a refuge for Dunmer displaced by the eruption of Red Mountain, though they face suspicion and neglect from the local Nords.

The hold is home to Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, leader of the Stormcloak rebellion. Eastmarch''s diverse landscape includes sulfur pools and rocky crags in the central and southern regions, bordered by the Velothi Mountains, while the northern parts feature snowy tundra and icy terrain. The Darkwater and White Rivers carve through the hold, converging at Windhelm before flowing into the Sea of Ghosts.

Flora and fauna in Eastmarch reflect its varied geography. The sulfur pools are home to creatures like giants, sabre cats, and Jazbay grapes, while the snowy regions feature frost trolls, snowy sabre cats, and snowberry bushes. Pine forests and shrublands surrounding the pools host thistle, mountain flowers, and mora tapinella. Key roads form a north-south loop skirting the sulfur pools, with branches leading to the Rift, Whiterun, and beyond. Eastmarch''s harsh beauty, rich resources, and strategic position make it a vital and contested region in Skyrim.', '''an'':65B,80B ''and'':32B,46B,70B,108B,114B,129B,134B,152B,171B,184B,189B,198B,220B,228B,235B ''are'':163B ''at'':142B ''beauty'':225B ''befor'':144B ''beyond'':221B ''bord'':54B ''border'':24B,117B ''branch'':214B ''bush'':186B ''by'':25B,118B ''capital'':11B ''carv'':137B ''cats'':170B,183B ''central'':113B ''connects'':55B ''contest'':236B ''converging'':141B ''corn'':18B ''crags'':110B ''creatur'':166B ''darkwat'':133B ''div'':103B ''dunm'':84B ''eastern'':7B,53B ''eastmarch'':1A,2B,64B,101B,155B,222B ''especially'':85B ''faun'':153B ''featur'':126B,178B ''flor'':151B ''flowers'':197B ''flowing'':145B ''for'':68B ''forests'':188B ''form'':203B ''frost'':179B ''gateway'':67B ''geography'':159B ''ghosts'':150B ''giants'':168B ''grap'':173B ''harsh'':224B ''hold'':5B,34B,77B,89B,140B ''hom'':91B,164B ''host'':194B ''icy'':130B ''important'':66B ''in'':6B,12B,15B,86B,111B,154B,238B ''includ'':105B ''increas'':81B ''into'':146B ''is'':3B,23B,90B ''it'':22B,232B ''its'':10B,157B ''jarl'':93B ''jazbay'':172B ''key'':201B ''landscap'':104B ''lead'':96B ''leading'':215B ''lik'':167B ''locat'':14B ''loop'':208B ''mak'':231B ''making'':63B ''migration'':71B ''mor'':199B ''morrowind'':57B ''mountain'':61B,196B ''mountains'':121B ''north'':206B ''north-south'':205B ''northeastern'':17B ''northern'':124B ''northwest'':29B ''of'':19B,40B,83B,97B,149B ''pal'':31B ''parts'':125B ''pass'':62B ''pin'':187B ''pools'':107B,162B,193B,212B ''position'':230B ''presenc'':82B ''provinc'':21B ''rebellion'':100B ''red'':74B ''reflect'':156B ''region'':237B ''regions'':116B,177B ''resourc'':227B ''rich'':226B ''rift'':48B,218B ''rivers'':136B ''roads'':202B ''rocky'':109B ''s'':102B,223B ''sabr'':169B,182B ''seen'':79B ''shrublands'':190B ''sinc'':72B ''skirting'':209B ''skyrim'':8B,239B ''snowberry'':185B ''snowy'':127B,176B,181B ''south'':51B,207B ''southern'':115B ''southwest'':45B ''stormcloak'':95B,99B ''strategic'':229B ''sulfur'':106B,161B,211B ''surrounding'':191B ''tapinell'':200B ''terrain'':131B ''the'':16B,20B,28B,30B,36B,38B,41B,44B,47B,50B,52B,59B,73B,76B,88B,98B,112B,119B,123B,132B,139B,147B,160B,175B,192B,210B,217B ''thistl'':195B ''throat'':39B ''through'':138B ''to'':27B,35B,43B,49B,56B,92B,165B,216B ''trad'':69B ''trolls'':180B ''tundr'':128B ''ulfric'':94B ''vari'':158B ''velothi'':60B,120B ''via'':58B ''vital'':234B ''west'':37B ''whil'':122B,174B ''whit'':135B ''whiterun'':33B,219B ''windhelm'':13B,87B,143B ''winterhold'':26B ''with'':9B,213B ''world'':42B ''year'':75B', 'eastmarch, noble, scholar', 'Eastmarch is a hold in northeastern Skyrim, with Windhelm as its capital.

Due to the nearby glacial icefields, Dawnstar is the last major port before Windhelm that remains ice-free following the Great Collapse. Its economy is supported by its two productive mines: Iron-Breaker Mine, which supplies iron, and Quicksilver Mine, which produces quicksilver. Additionally, fishing plays a significant role in the town''s livelihood.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('vvardenfell', 'Vvardenfell, also known as the Black Isle, is a large island situated within the bay-like Inner Sea of Morrowind, bordered by the mainland except for its northern coast, which meets the Sea of Ghosts. The island is dominated by the towering volcano, Red Mountain, and derives its name from the original Dwemeri term for the mountain, meaning "City of the Strong Shield." The landscape of Vvardenfell is characterized by arid wastelands, rocky highlands, and coastal wetlands that host a variety of unique flora and fauna. The volcanic activity of Red Mountain, including lava flows and ash-falls, contributes to a constant cycle of ecological renewal, enriching the soil and allowing new plants and fungi to flourish in the aftermath of eruptions.

Historically, Vvardenfell was home to House Dagoth, the only Chimer clan with its capital located on the island, alongside a significant Dwemer kingdom.

Its layout features grand timber palaces surrounded by symmetrical moon-sugarcane gardens, where the Mane meditates and governs. The city is renowned for its rare ochre pigment, southern wines, and temples like the famed Temple of Two-Moons Dance, a hub for hand-to-hand combat training that attracts students from across Tamriel.

Throughout its history, Torval has endured various challenges, from the dissolution of the sixteen kingdoms following the Thrassian Plague to its involvement in conflicts such as the Five Year War and the Slaughter of Torval. In the Second Era, under the leadership of Mane Akkhuz-ri and his Speaker, Lord Gharesh-ri, Torval played a pivotal role in forming the Aldmeri Dominion during the Knahaten Flu crisis. By the Third Era, the city saw rebellion, cultural vibrancy, and significant events such as Emperor Pelagius III''s legendary asylum ball.

It is believed to have been founded by the legendary mage Shalidor, though this claim, like many others associated with him, is shrouded in mystery. The College boasts documents from as far back as the late Second Era and houses some of Tamriel''s most valuable arcane knowledge.

A selective institution, the College admits only those who prove their aptitude in the magical arts. Once enrolled, students enjoy greater freedom in their studies, including the practice of controversial magic such as Necromancy. The College''s central building, the Hall of the Elements, serves as the site for all types of magical practice and contains the famous Arcanaeum library. The Arch-Mage’s quarters are located within, while students and faculty are housed in separate accommodations. Beneath the College lies the Midden, a mysterious underground area that holds many of the College''s secrets. The Eye of Shalidor, a symbol of the institution, is displayed prominently across the campus, honoring the College''s ancient roots.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('solstheim', 'Solstheim is a large island located in the Sea of Ghosts, to the north of Tamriel, with a history that stretches back to the ancient Snow Elves, the first inhabitants of the region. They built grand settlements on Solstheim that outlasted their mainland holdings, leaving a lasting mark on the island. Though the island has been home to various races over the centuries, it has traditionally been dominated by Nordic influence. In 4E 16, Solstheim officially became part of Morrowind.

The island’s history took a tragic turn during the Red Year of 4E 5, when the eruption of Red Mountain devastated the southern half of Solstheim. Fort Frostmoth was destroyed, leaving the Imperial garrison in disarray and killing General Carius. Raven Rock, a settlement on the island, quickly took over the remnants of the garrison and was fortified by elite members of the Redoran Guard. In the aftermath of the eruption, the ash from Red Mountain transformed the southern part of the island into vast ashlands. To protect Raven Rock from the encroaching ash, Brara Morvayn designed and oversaw the construction of a great stone wall known as the Bulwark, funded by the East Empire Company.

In 4E 16, as part of a political compromise, Skyrim ceded control of Solstheim to Morrowind. While this act appeared to be a compassionate gesture toward the Dunmer, it was driven by political motives. Skyrim sought to avoid a conflict with Morrowind, which had long claimed the island, and by relinquishing control, it preserved its image as a savior to the Dunmer. As a result, many Dunmer refugees, including members of the minor House Sathil, began flocking to the island. The East Empire Company was forced to hand over control of Raven Rock to House Redoran, and by 4E 48, Solstheim was no longer considered part of the Empire.', '''16'':75B,201B ''48'':298B ''4e'':74B,95B,200B,297B ''5'':96B ''act'':217B ''aftermath'':150B ''ancient'':26B ''and'':119B,138B,180B,247B,295B ''appear'':218B ''as'':190B,202B,255B,261B ''ash'':155B,176B ''ashlands'':168B ''avo'':236B ''back'':23B ''be'':220B ''becam'':78B ''been'':57B,68B ''beg'':274B ''brar'':177B ''built'':36B ''bulwark'':192B ''by'':70B,141B,194B,230B,248B,296B ''carius'':122B ''ced'':209B ''centuri'':64B ''claim'':244B ''company'':198B,282B ''compassionat'':222B ''compromis'':207B ''conflict'':238B ''consider'':303B ''construction'':183B ''control'':210B,250B,288B ''design'':179B ''destroy'':112B ''devastat'':103B ''disarray'':118B ''dominat'':69B ''driv'':229B ''dunm'':226B,260B,265B ''during'':90B ''east'':196B,280B ''elit'':142B ''elves'':28B ''empir'':197B,281B,307B ''encroaching'':175B ''eruption'':99B,153B ''first'':30B ''flocking'':275B ''forc'':284B ''fort'':109B ''fortifi'':140B ''from'':156B,173B ''frostmoth'':110B ''fund'':193B ''garrison'':116B,137B ''general'':121B ''gestur'':223B ''ghosts'':12B ''grand'':37B ''great'':186B ''guard'':147B ''had'':242B ''half'':106B ''hand'':286B ''history'':20B,85B ''holdings'':45B ''hom'':58B ''hous'':272B,293B ''imag'':254B ''imperial'':115B ''in'':8B,73B,117B,148B,199B ''including'':267B ''influenc'':72B ''inhabitants'':31B ''into'':166B ''is'':3B ''island'':6B,52B,55B,83B,129B,165B,246B,278B ''it'':65B,227B,251B ''its'':253B ''killing'':120B ''known'':189B ''larg'':5B ''lasting'':48B ''leaving'':46B,113B ''locat'':7B ''long'':243B,302B ''mainland'':44B ''many'':264B ''mark'':49B ''members'':143B,268B ''minor'':271B ''morrowind'':81B,214B,240B ''morvayn'':178B ''motiv'':232B ''mountain'':102B,158B ''nordic'':71B ''north'':15B ''of'':11B,16B,32B,80B,94B,100B,107B,135B,144B,151B,163B,184B,204B,211B,269B,289B,305B ''officially'':77B ''on'':39B,50B,127B ''outlast'':42B ''over'':62B,132B,287B ''oversaw'':181B ''part'':79B,162B,203B,304B ''political'':206B,231B ''preserv'':252B ''protect'':170B ''quickly'':130B ''rac'':61B ''rav'':123B,171B,290B ''red'':92B,101B,157B ''redor'':146B,294B ''refug'':266B ''region'':34B ''relinquishing'':249B ''remnants'':134B ''result'':263B ''rock'':124B,172B,291B ''s'':84B ''sathil'':273B ''savior'':257B ''settlement'':126B ''settlements'':38B ''skyrim'':208B,233B ''snow'':27B ''solstheim'':1A,2B,40B,76B,108B,212B,299B ''sought'':234B ''southern'':105B,161B ''ston'':187B ''stretch'':22B ''tamriel'':17B ''that'':21B,41B ''the'':9B,14B,25B,29B,33B,43B,51B,54B,63B,82B,91B,98B,104B,114B,128B,133B,136B,145B,149B,152B,154B,160B,164B,174B,182B,191B,195B,225B,245B,259B,270B,277B,279B,306B ''they'':35B ''this'':216B ''though'':53B ''to'':13B,24B,59B,169B,213B,219B,235B,258B,276B,285B,292B ''took'':86B,131B ''toward'':224B ''traditionally'':67B ''tragic'':88B ''transform'':159B ''turn'':89B ''various'':60B ''vast'':167B ''wall'':188B ''was'':111B,139B,228B,283B,300B ''when'':97B ''which'':241B ''whil'':215B ''with'':18B,239B ''year'':93B', 'solstheim, noble, scholar', 'Solstheim is a large island located in the Sea of Ghosts, to the north of Tamriel, with a history that stretches back to the ancient Snow Elves, the first inhabitants of the region.

At its peak, the great workshops of Nchardak were capable of producing a complete automaton each day, supplying much of the Dwemer army that fought in the Battle of Red Mountain.

Today, much of Nchardak remains flooded, but its ancient mechanisms can still be activated using control cubes found within the ruin.

The most significant of these occurred during the Sun''s Death in 1E 668, the Days of Fire in 2E 882, and the Red Year in 4E 5, the latter causing widespread devastation and a mass exodus of the local population. The volcano is considered one of the most dangerous regions in Vvardenfell, with its ash storms and treacherous terrain.

The Dwemer established settlements around Red Mountain during the Merethic Era, and the location was the site of the pivotal Battle of Red Mountain in the First Era, which resulted in the mysterious disappearance of the Dwemer and the rise of the Tribunal. In later centuries, the volcano became associated with Dagoth Ur, a being who emerged from within it and challenged the Tribunal''s power. To contain the Ash Blight emanating from the mountain, the Tribunal constructed the Ghostfence, restricting access to the area. Following the defeat of Dagoth Ur by the Nerevarine in 3E 427, the stability of the mountain was further compromised, leading to the catastrophic Red Year eruption in 4E 5.

Originally known as the Temple of the Ancestors, the tower housed the Ten Ancestors, a collection of statues made from meteoric iron and glass. Established as an independent city-state around 1E 0, the tower remained a significant political and cultural center until the Alessian Slave Rebellion culminated in its capture in 1E 243.

Its origins trace back to the Merethic Era, when the Aldmer constructed the White-Gold Tower as a temple, marking the beginnings of Ayleid civilization in the region. Over centuries, the city became the seat of power for various empires, from Alessia''s rebellion to the rise of the Reman and Septim Dynasties. Despite its grandeur, the city has endured numerous challenges, including sieges, invasions, and disasters such as the Oblivion Crisis and the Great War.

The city is divided into several districts, each with distinct roles and architectural styles. Key areas include the Market District, a hub of commerce; the Arboretum, home to statues of the Divines; and the Temple District, housing the Temple of the One.

Kvatch is a Colovian city located in the hinterlands of the Gold Coast, perched atop a bluff overlooking the surrounding forests. Known for its iconic coat of arms—a black Dire Wolf on a gray background—Kvatch features key landmarks such as the imposing Kvatch Castle, the Great Chapel of Akatosh, and a renowned arena. Its position along trade routes between Anvil and Skingrad has historically made it a significant settlement, with its county extending northwest to the Brena River at the Hammerfell border. The city has a storied history dating back to the First Era, including alliances formed during the collapse of the Alessian Empire and the founding of the Order of the Hour in the Second Era.

Throughout its history, Kvatch has faced numerous challenges, including the sack by the Camoran Usurper in 3E 249 and the devastating Oblivion Crisis in 3E 433, during which the city was razed by Daedra. Despite the destruction, the city''s courage and resilience were epitomized by figures like Antus Pinder, memorialized with a statue for his valiant defense of the city. By the Fourth Era, Kvatch was rebuilt and restored to prominence, contributing to Cyrodiil''s defense during the Great War. Its enduring legacy is one of resilience and recovery, standing as a testament to the strength of its people and their faith in Akatosh.', '''249'':138B ''3e'':137B,145B ''433'':146B ''akatosh'':52B,225B ''alessi'':106B ''allianc'':99B ''along'':59B ''and'':53B,64B,108B,139B,162B,189B,209B,221B ''antus'':169B ''anvil'':63B ''aren'':56B ''arms'':29B ''as'':43B,212B ''at'':82B ''atop'':16B ''back'':93B ''background'':37B ''betw'':62B ''black'':31B ''bluff'':18B ''bord'':85B ''bren'':80B ''by'':132B,153B,166B,182B ''camor'':134B ''castl'':47B ''challeng'':128B ''chapel'':50B ''city'':6B,87B,150B,159B,181B ''coast'':14B ''coat'':27B ''collaps'':103B ''colovi'':5B ''contributing'':193B ''county'':75B ''courag'':161B ''crisis'':143B ''cyrodiil'':195B ''daedr'':154B ''dating'':92B ''defens'':178B,197B ''despit'':155B ''destruction'':157B ''devastating'':141B ''dir'':32B ''during'':101B,147B,198B ''empir'':107B ''enduring'':203B ''epitomiz'':165B ''extending'':76B ''fac'':126B ''faith'':223B ''featur'':39B ''figur'':167B ''first'':96B ''for'':24B,175B ''forests'':22B ''form'':100B ''founding'':110B ''fourth'':184B ''gold'':13B ''gray'':36B ''great'':49B,200B ''hammerfell'':84B ''hinterlands'':10B ''his'':176B ''historically'':67B ''history'':91B,123B ''hour'':116B ''iconic'':26B ''imposing'':45B ''in'':8B,117B,136B,144B,224B ''including'':98B,129B ''is'':3B,205B ''it'':69B ''its'':25B,57B,74B,122B,202B,219B ''key'':40B ''known'':23B ''kvatch'':1A,2B,38B,46B,124B,186B ''landmarks'':41B ''legacy'':204B ''lik'':168B ''locat'':7B ''mad'':68B ''memorializ'':171B ''northwest'':77B ''numerous'':127B ''oblivion'':142B ''of'':11B,28B,51B,104B,111B,114B,179B,207B,218B ''on'':34B ''one'':206B ''order'':113B ''overlooking'':19B ''peopl'':220B ''perch'':15B ''pind'':170B ''position'':58B ''prominenc'':192B ''raz'':152B ''rebuilt'':188B ''recovery'':210B ''renown'':55B ''resilienc'':163B,208B ''restor'':190B ''riv'':81B ''rout'':61B ''s'':160B,196B ''sack'':131B ''second'':119B ''settlement'':72B ''significant'':71B ''skingr'':65B ''standing'':211B ''statu'':174B ''stori'':90B ''strength'':217B ''such'':42B ''surrounding'':21B ''testament'':214B ''the'':9B,12B,20B,44B,48B,79B,83B,86B,95B,102B,105B,109B,112B,115B,118B,130B,133B,140B,149B,156B,158B,180B,183B,199B,216B,222B ''throughout'':121B ''to'':78B,94B,191B,194B,215B ''trad'':60B ''usurp'':135B ''valiant'':177B ''war'':201B ''was'':151B,187B ''wer'':164B ''which'':148B ''with'':73B,172B ''wolf'':33B', 'scholar, imperial', '

Cyrodiil, the heartland of Tamriel and home to the Imperials, serves as the seat of the Empire and the location of its capital, the Imperial City. Dominated by the iconic White-Gold Tower, Cyrodiil is central to Tamriel''s history and culture. Though initially described as a jungle, its climate is temperate, possibly altered by Emperor Tiber Septim. The province''s early history is marked by the rule of the Ayleids, who enslaved the native Nedic people. The rebellion led by Alessia in 1E 242 ended Ayleid dominance, establishing the Alessian Empire and shaping Cyrodiil into a center of human governance and culture. The Alessians expanded westward, influenced by the prophet Marukh''s teachings, which codified much of Tamriel’s religion.

Cyrodiil’s history is defined by cycles of conquest and upheaval, from the Akaviri invasion of 1E 2703, which united Tamriel under Emperor Reman I, to the eventual collapse of the Second Empire. The chaos of the Interregnum ended with Tiber Septim''s rise, uniting Tamriel under the Third Empire. The Fourth Era brought new challenges, including the Great War against the Aldmeri Dominion, marked by the brutal Battle of the Red Ring and the controversial White-Gold Concordat. While Cyrodiil remains the seat of the Empire, these events have left a lasting impact, straining relations with Skyrim and reshaping the political landscape of Tamriel.', '''1e'':86B,140B ''242'':87B ''2703'':141B ''against'':184B ''akaviri'':137B ''aldmeri'':186B ''alessi'':84B,93B ''alessians'':107B ''alter'':56B ''and'':7B,19B,43B,95B,104B,133B,197B,223B ''as'':13B,48B ''ayle'':89B ''ayleids'':73B ''battl'':192B ''brought'':177B ''brutal'':191B ''by'':29B,57B,68B,83B,111B,129B,189B ''capital'':24B ''cent'':100B ''central'':38B ''cha'':158B ''challeng'':179B ''city'':27B ''climat'':52B ''codifi'':118B ''collaps'':152B ''concordat'':203B ''conquest'':132B ''controversial'':199B ''cultur'':44B,105B ''cycles'':130B ''cyrodiil'':1A,2B,36B,97B,124B,205B ''defin'':128B ''describ'':47B ''dominanc'':90B ''dominat'':28B ''dominion'':187B ''early'':64B ''emperor'':58B,146B ''empir'':18B,94B,156B,173B,211B ''ended'':88B,162B ''enslav'':75B ''establishing'':91B ''events'':213B ''eventual'':151B ''expand'':108B ''fourth'':175B ''from'':135B ''gold'':34B,202B ''governanc'':103B ''great'':182B ''hav'':214B ''heartland'':4B ''history'':42B,65B,126B ''hom'':8B ''hum'':102B ''i'':148B ''iconic'':31B ''impact'':218B ''imperial'':26B ''imperials'':11B ''in'':85B ''including'':180B ''influenc'':110B ''initially'':46B ''interregnum'':161B ''into'':98B ''invasion'':138B ''is'':37B,53B,66B,127B ''its'':23B,51B ''jungl'':50B ''landscap'':227B ''lasting'':217B ''led'':82B ''left'':215B ''location'':21B ''mark'':67B,188B ''marukh'':114B ''much'':119B ''nativ'':77B ''nedic'':78B ''new'':178B ''of'':5B,16B,22B,71B,101B,120B,131B,139B,153B,159B,193B,209B,228B ''peopl'':79B ''political'':226B ''possibly'':55B ''prophet'':113B ''provinc'':62B ''rebellion'':81B ''red'':195B ''relations'':220B ''religion'':123B ''rem'':147B ''remains'':206B ''reshaping'':224B ''ring'':196B ''ris'':167B ''rul'':70B ''s'':41B,63B,115B,122B,125B,166B ''seat'':15B,208B ''second'':155B ''septim'':60B,165B ''serv'':12B ''shaping'':96B ''skyrim'':222B ''straining'':219B ''tamriel'':6B,40B,121B,144B,169B,229B ''teachings'':116B ''temperat'':54B ''the'':3B,10B,14B,17B,20B,25B,30B,61B,69B,72B,76B,80B,92B,106B,112B,136B,150B,154B,157B,160B,171B,174B,181B,185B,190B,194B,198B,207B,210B,225B ''thes'':212B ''third'':172B ''though'':45B ''tib'':59B,164B ''to'':9B,39B,149B ''tow'':35B ''under'':145B,170B ''unit'':143B ''uniting'':168B ''upheaval'':134B ''war'':183B ''westward'':109B ''which'':117B,142B ''whil'':204B ''whit'':33B,201B ''white-gold'':32B,200B ''who'':74B ''with'':163B,221B', 'scholar, imperial, noble', '

Historically, the land was home to sixteen Khajiiti clans, which evolved into kingdoms named after their regions, but hardships such as the Thrassian Plague led to their consolidation into the two kingdoms of Anequina and Pellitine. These eventually united as the Elsweyr Confederacy, only to split again during the Third Aldmeri Dominion.

Elsweyr shares borders with Valenwood to the west, Cyrodiil to the north and east, and has access to Topal Bay and the Southern Sea to the south.

Its symbol, the Ivory Horse, is steeped in myth, with ties to Pelinal Whitestrake or a legendary white horse that once protected the riverbanks. Leyawiin honors Topal the Pilot as its patron saint, and his statue adorns the city’s southwest wall, reflecting its cultural heritage.

Historically, Leyawiin has experienced repeated upheavals and significant cultural shifts. After its involvement in the Alessian Slave Rebellion in the First Era, it fell under Khajiiti control during the Anequine Conquests. By the Second Era, Leyawiin''s governance transitioned towards the influential Chamber of Legates, and it endured political and military turmoil during the Three Banners War. In the Third Era, tensions arose from its annexation of the Trans-Niben and the racial frictions among its diverse population. Leyawiin faced destruction during the Oblivion Crisis and later, in the Fourth Era, suffered Dominion occupation during the Great War. Throughout its history, Leyawiin has remained a dynamic city, shaped by its strategic location and resilient populace.', '''adorns'':102B ''after'':122B ''alessi'':127B ''among'':187B ''and'':47B,63B,99B,118B,157B,161B,183B,198B,225B ''anequin'':141B ''annexation'':177B ''aros'':174B ''as'':23B,95B ''at'':10B ''banners'':167B ''bay'':21B ''betw'':45B ''black'':48B ''by'':143B,221B ''castl'':64B ''chamb'':154B ''chapel'':57B ''city'':5B,25B,51B,104B,219B ''conquests'':142B ''control'':138B ''crisis'':197B ''cultural'':110B,120B ''cyrodiil'':8B ''destruction'':193B ''district'':58B ''districts'':56B ''div'':189B ''divid'':53B ''dominion'':205B ''during'':139B,164B,194B,207B ''dynamic'':218B ''elsweyr'':46B ''endur'':159B ''experienc'':115B ''fac'':192B ''fell'':135B ''first'':132B ''four'':55B ''fourth'':202B ''frictions'':186B ''from'':175B ''governanc'':149B ''great'':209B ''guild'':59B ''heritag'':111B ''his'':100B ''historically'':112B ''history'':213B ''honors'':91B ''hors'':70B,84B ''in'':6B,73B,125B,130B,169B,200B ''influential'':153B ''into'':54B ''involvement'':124B ''is'':52B,71B ''it'':18B,30B,134B,158B ''its'':66B,96B,109B,123B,176B,188B,212B,222B ''ivory'':69B ''khajiiti'':137B ''known'':22B ''land'':44B ''lat'':199B ''legat'':156B ''legendary'':82B ''leyawiin'':1A,2B,65B,90B,113B,147B,191B,214B ''location'':224B ''main'':61B ''marsh'':49B ''meets'':19B ''military'':162B ''mouth'':12B ''myth'':74B ''narrow'':41B ''nib'':15B,39B,182B ''nibenes'':4B ''oblivion'':196B ''occupation'':206B ''occupi'':31B ''of'':13B,43B,155B,178B ''on'':35B ''once'':86B ''or'':80B ''patron'':97B ''pelinal'':78B ''pilot'':94B ''plaz'':60B ''political'':160B ''populac'':227B ''population'':190B ''position'':34B ''protect'':87B ''racial'':185B ''rebellion'':129B ''reflecting'':108B ''remain'':216B ''repeat'':116B ''resilient'':226B ''riv'':16B ''riverbanks'':89B ''s'':105B,148B ''saint'':98B ''second'':145B ''shap'':220B ''shifts'':121B ''significant'':119B ''sits'':9B ''slav'':128B ''southeastern'':7B ''southwest'':106B ''spans'':27B ''statu'':101B ''steep'':72B ''strategic'':223B ''street'':62B ''strip'':42B ''suffer'':204B ''symbol'':67B ''tensions'':173B ''that'':26B,85B ''the'':11B,14B,24B,28B,36B,40B,50B,68B,88B,93B,103B,126B,131B,140B,144B,152B,165B,170B,179B,184B,195B,201B,208B ''third'':171B ''thre'':166B ''throughout'':211B ''ties'':76B ''to'':77B ''topal'':20B,92B ''towards'':151B ''trans'':38B,181B ''trans-nib'':37B,180B ''transition'':150B ''turmoil'':163B ''under'':136B ''upheavals'':117B ''vital'':33B ''wall'':107B ''war'':168B,210B ''waters'':29B ''wher'':17B ''whit'':83B ''whitestrak'':79B ''with'':75B', 'scholar, imperial', 'Leyawiin is a Nibenese city located at the mouth of the Niben River, known as "the city that spans the waters."

The city''s landmarks include the Chapel of Dibella, the mysterious Mermaid Statue, and Benirus Manor, which carries a dark history of necromancy. Anvil also hosts the Fighters Guild and a Mages Guild chapter specializing in Restoration. Historically, the city served as a pirate haven before being transformed into a fortified settlement by King Bendu Olo, who led the All Flags Navy against the Sload in the First Era.

Throughout its history, Anvil has endured periods of turmoil and prosperity. In the Second Era, it became a free city under pirate control, and during the Oblivion Crisis in the Third Era, it faced attacks by Daedra, thieves, and the Dark Brotherhood.

Initially a vibrant settlement marked by its sacred crypts and fortifications, it fell into ruin after the collapse of the Reman Dynasty. Over the centuries, Sancre Tor became a haunted site, known for its crypts filled with undead and its ties to pivotal events such as the hiding of the Amulet of Kings during the Second Era.

Throughout history, Sancre Tor played a significant role in the Elder Scrolls lore, serving as a battleground for General Talos (later Tiber Septim) during the Tiber Wars and as the site of his eventual ascension to godhood. In the Third Era, the ruins were corrupted by the Underking and sealed by the Blades, with its guardians cursed to undeath. The Hero of Kvatch later unsealed the ruins, freed the cursed Blades, and retrieved the Armor of Tiber Septim during their quest.

Skingrad, a prominent Colovian town in the West Weald region of Cyrodiil, is celebrated for its prosperity, cultural significance, and agricultural contributions, particularly its renowned wines, tomatoes, and cheeses. Known as the "Gem of Old Colovia," Skingrad embodies Colovian virtues of independence, hard work, and resilience. Governed by Count Janus Hassildor during the late Third Era, the town flourished under his strict leadership, minimizing crime and maintaining order. Its vineyards, such as those owned by the Surilie brothers and Tamika, have made Skingrad a centerpiece of Cyrodiil''s winemaking tradition. Architecturally, the town is divided into districts connected by gates and bridges, featuring landmarks like the Great Chapel of Julianos and Castle Skingrad, the count''s residence and rumored haven for his vampirism.

Historically, Skingrad played a key role in resisting the Alessian Order''s theocratic dominance, contributing to the formation of the autonomous Colovian Estates. Under figures like King Rislav Larich, it became a bastion of independence and military strength, defeating the Alessian forces and helping dissolve their rule. The town''s importance continued through the eras, from its Second Era reputation as a center for intellectuals and winemaking to its survival of the Oblivion Crisis in the Third Era, where it benefited from the Hero of Kvatch’s aid.

Known for its strategic trade location and Hlaalu-style architecture, Balmora played a vital role in the economic and political landscape of Vvardenfell, acting as a gateway between the region''s rugged landscapes and fertile coastlines. Significant landmarks included the Hlaalu Council Manor, the Tribunal Temple, and the Moonmoth Imperial Legion Fort.

Historically, Balmora was initially a House Redoran stronghold before it was transformed by House Hlaalu through strategic construction projects and business maneuvers. During the Third Era, it grew under Imperial influence, becoming a hub of trade and administration. It played a central role in the Nerevarine Prophecy when the outlander destined to fulfill the prophecy operated from Balmora under the guidance of Caius Cosades. However, the city was devastated in the Red Year (4E 5) due to the eruption of Red Mountain, leaving it in ruins.

However, Seyda Neen''s fate remains uncertain following the Red Year (4E 5) and the catastrophic eruption of Red Mountain, which devastated Vvardenfell and surrounding regions.

Located near Vivec City, it served as the administrative center for the Vvardenfell district under the leadership of Duke Vedam Dren and his Grand Council. The castle housed the Imperial Chapels, which supported the Duke, his retainers, and the garrison, and acted as a central base for the Imperial Cult. Security was paramount, with the Duke protected by an elite Imperial Guard unit and the Hawkmoth Legion stationed within the castle walls. Castle Ebonheart was a hub for Imperial and House Hlaalu affairs, as the Duke also held the title of Hlaalu Grandmaster. Adjacent to the castle were the East Empire Company offices, bolstered by Imperial security, and diplomatic missions from Skyrim and Black Marsh, the latter advocating for its citizens under Morrowind''s unique legal exemptions regarding slavery.

The castle''s origins date back to 2E 582, when Vivec, inspired by the mainland city of Ebonheart, decreed the creation of a counterpart on Vvardenfell. However, it was not until 3E 414, following Vvardenfell''s opening for settlement, that Castle Ebonheart was constructed. It quickly became the Imperial capital of the island and a focal point for governance, trade, and diplomacy. Tragically, the proximity of Castle Ebonheart to Vivec City likely led to its destruction in 4E 5, during the Red Year, when the Ministry of Truth fell, triggering the eruption of Red Mountain and devastating the region.', '''2e'':154B ''3e'':178B ''414'':179B ''4e'':224B ''5'':225B ''582'':155B ''acted'':59B ''adjacent'':111B ''administrativ'':26B ''advocating'':135B ''affairs'':100B ''also'':4B,104B ''an'':76B ''and'':39B,55B,58B,81B,97B,125B,130B,200B,207B,242B ''as'':8B,24B,60B,101B ''authority'':15B ''back'':152B ''bas'':63B ''becam'':193B ''black'':131B ''bolster'':121B ''by'':75B,122B,159B ''capital'':196B ''castl'':2B,44B,88B,90B,114B,148B,187B,213B ''cent'':27B ''central'':62B ''chapels'':48B ''citizens'':138B ''city'':21B,162B,217B ''company'':119B ''construct'':190B ''council'':42B ''counterpart'':170B ''creation'':167B ''cult'':67B ''dat'':151B ''decr'':165B ''destruction'':222B ''devastating'':243B ''diplomacy'':208B ''diplomatic'':126B ''district'':31B ''dren'':38B ''duk'':36B,52B,73B,103B ''during'':226B ''east'':117B ''ebonheart'':1A,3B,9B,91B,164B,188B,214B ''elit'':77B ''empir'':118B ''eruption'':238B ''exemptions'':144B ''fell'':235B ''focal'':202B ''following'':180B ''for'':28B,64B,95B,136B,184B,204B ''from'':128B ''garrison'':57B ''governanc'':205B ''grand'':41B ''grandmast'':110B ''guard'':79B ''hawkmoth'':83B ''held'':105B ''his'':40B,53B ''hlaalu'':99B,109B ''hous'':45B,98B ''howev'':173B ''hub'':12B,94B ''imperial'':14B,47B,66B,78B,96B,123B,195B ''in'':223B ''inspir'':158B ''island'':199B ''it'':22B,174B,191B ''its'':137B,221B ''latt'':134B ''leadership'':34B ''led'':219B ''legal'':143B ''legion'':84B ''likely'':218B ''locat'':18B ''mainland'':161B ''marsh'':132B ''ministry'':232B ''missions'':127B ''morrowind'':140B ''mountain'':241B ''near'':19B ''not'':176B ''of'':13B,35B,108B,163B,168B,197B,212B,233B,239B ''offic'':120B ''on'':16B,171B ''opening'':183B ''origins'':150B ''paramount'':70B ''point'':203B ''protect'':74B ''proximity'':211B ''quickly'':192B ''red'':228B,240B ''referr'':5B ''regarding'':145B ''region'':245B ''retainers'':54B ''s'':141B,149B,182B ''security'':68B,124B ''serv'':23B ''settlement'':185B ''simply'':7B ''skyrim'':129B ''slavery'':146B ''station'':85B ''support'':50B ''that'':186B ''the'':11B,25B,29B,33B,43B,46B,51B,56B,65B,72B,82B,87B,102B,106B,113B,116B,133B,147B,160B,166B,194B,198B,210B,227B,231B,237B,244B ''titl'':107B ''to'':6B,112B,153B,215B,220B ''trad'':206B ''tragically'':209B ''triggering'':236B ''truth'':234B ''under'':32B,139B ''uniqu'':142B ''unit'':80B ''until'':177B ''vedam'':37B ''vivec'':20B,157B,216B ''vvardenfell'':17B,30B,172B,181B ''walls'':89B ''was'':10B,69B,92B,175B,189B ''wer'':115B ''when'':156B,230B ''which'':49B ''with'':71B ''within'':86B ''year'':229B', 'scholar, darkelf', 'Castle Ebonheart, located near Vivec City on Vvardenfell, was the administrative center for the Imperial authority in the region, serving as the hub for governance, trade, and diplomacy under Duke Vedam Dren.

It exists outside conventional space and time, accessible through magical means like the Clockwork Globe. The city consists of three main regions: the Radius, a wilderness emulating Tamriel''s biomes; the Brass Fortress, the central settlement; and the Mechanical Fundament, housing Sotha Sil''s control center, the Throne Aligned. The City is maintained by structures like the Halls of Regulation, which sustain its ecosystem, and the Mnemonic Planisphere, which stores Sotha Sil’s memories. The Clockwork Apostles, its inhabitants, strive to create a "perfect Nirn" by blending mer and machine.

Throughout history, the Clockwork City has been a site of conflict and innovation. Sotha Sil modeled much of the City''s technology on Dwemer designs but ultimately evolved a unique style. Significant events include the creation of the Mechanical Heart, a replacement for the Heart of Lorkhan, and Sotha Sil''s murder by Almalexia in 3E 427. The City faced threats from Daedric Princes, rogue Apostles, and internal strife.

This ancient city, built on a steep, mountainous island surrounded by cliffs, features a dense layout with interconnected districts, including its renowned Necropolis. Its white towers and lofty walls are nestled beneath the rib-like rock formations, believed to be the remains of GULGA MOR JIL, a mythical creature from Tribunal mythology. Governed by the Keepers of the Dead, a monastic order under House Indoril''s authority, Necrom serves as a hub for pilgrims, traders, and mourners, drawing Dunmer back to their ancestral roots through its festivals, rituals, and sacred spaces. The Necropolis and its catacombs house countless ancestral remains, where spirits are honored and released into the afterlife, reflecting the city''s deep connection to death and remembrance.

Necrom''s history stretches back to the Merethic Era, predating the Tribunal Temple. Its origins are tied to Chimer traditions and myths, such as Vivec’s defeat of GULGA MOR JIL, which laid the city''s foundation. Over the eras, Necrom has endured cultural and political changes, including its role in supporting the Ghostfence and adapting to the rise of the New Temple in the Fourth Era.

It has weathered conflicts with Maormer and Sload, contributed to the All Flags Navy, and led the formation of the Aldmeri Dominions under leaders like Queen Ayrenn. The city played a pivotal role in resisting Tiber Septim''s conquests, though it ultimately fell to the Numidium, leading to the integration of Summerset into the Third Empire.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('marbruk', 'Marbruk, located in the forested region of Greenshade in Valenwood, serves as a significant historical and cultural site. Originally settled by an Ayleid clan following the Alessian Slave Rebellion, the city evolved into a Bosmer settlement before being transformed into a fortified bastion by the Aldmeri Dominion in 2E 580. Built to defend Greenshade from external threats, its construction showcased modern Altmeri architecture, blending imported materials to respect the Green Pact while constructing atop ancient Ayleid ruins. The city became a symbol of Dominion unity but also sparked cultural tensions, as the Altmer enforced restrictions on traditional Bosmer practices. Marbruk''s Mages Guild vault housed priceless artifacts, including the Staff of Magnus, which played a central role in a Veiled Heritance attack led by the lich Prince Naemon. The Dominion, with the Vestige''s aid, repelled the undead assault and secured the city.

Throughout its history, Marbruk changed hands multiple times, reflecting the shifting political landscape of Valenwood. It was annexed by the Second Aldmeri Dominion during a Camoran civil war in 2E 830 but fell to Tiber Septim''s forces following his use of the Numidium in 2E 896, becoming part of the Third Empire. By the Third Era, the city had diminished to a small settlement known as Marbruk Field, ruled by Lord Palinis and enduring periods of rebellion and strife, including the Camoran Usurper Rebellion and the Oblivion Crisis.

Its geography alternates between eerie open fields, an endless library of black-covered books, and a dark, inky sea populated by writhing tentacles. This plane, haunted by the ghosts of mortals seeking knowledge, features towering book stacks, labyrinthine mazes, and ominous ruins under an unnatural green sky. Entry is primarily granted through Black Books, powerful artifacts scattered across Tamriel. Mortals who venture into Apocrypha risk insanity from unending revelations, as the realm operates outside the laws of the mortal world. Among its inhabitants are grotesque Daedric servants like Seekers, Lurkers, and the Watchers, who catalog and guard its secrets.

The realm is dotted with significant locations, including the Infinite Panopticon, a pocket dimension holding Mora''s most precious and dangerous knowledge, and Cipher’s Midden, a mortal settlement governed by the Prince’s will.

The island''s history is intertwined with the Redguard colonization following the Dwemer disappearance and the arrival of the Ra Gada.

The island was the site of a pivotal battle where the Empire''s dragon, Nafaalilargus, and Admiral Richton secured victory. The rebellion led by Cyrus restored Redguard autonomy after the signing of the First Treaty of Stros M''Kai, legitimizing their rule under Tiber Septim. In the Fourth Era, the island played a key role in the Second Treaty of Stros M''Kai, marking Hammerfell''s independence from both the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion after resisting Dominion conquest during the Great War.

First established in the First Era by Chieftain Torug gro-Igron in the Wrothgarian Mountains, Orsinium became a symbol of Orc unity. It attracted refugees from Hammerfell and other regions, forming a stronghold that rivaled its neighbors. However, its ambition led to conflict, most notably the 30-year Siege of Orsinium (1E 950-980) by allied Breton, Redguard, and Yokudan forces, which resulted in its destruction. Despite this, Orsinium was rebuilt multiple times, each iteration representing the Orcs'' resilience and desire for recognition.

In the Second Era, King Kurog relocated Orsinium to eastern Wrothgar and allied it with the Daggerfall Covenant, seeking to unite the Orcs while navigating tensions with Bretons and Redguards. Following Kurog’s death, his successor, Bazrag, continued efforts toward unity while fostering peace. In the Third Era, Gortwog gro-Nagorm established Nova Orsinium near Wayrest, achieving political stability and prosperity through diplomacy. However, Orsinium faced destruction again in the Fourth Era after the Oblivion Crisis, forcing the Orcs to relocate to a site between Skyrim and Hammerfell.

INSERT INTO public.oghma VALUES ('orc_stronghold', '
Orc strongholds are fortified settlements primarily inhabited by Orcs, also known as Orsimer. These strongholds are typically located in remote, harsh regions such as Skyrim, Hammerfell, and Orsinium (the Orc homeland). They are often isolated from the rest of Tamrielic society, with the Orcs living a clan-based, warrior culture. The strongholds are often led by a chief, and Orcs are known for their crafting, particularly their skill in blacksmithing and the forging of weapons and armor. Though Orcs were once ostracized by other races, especially after the sacking of Orsinium, many Orcs now live in these strongholds, maintaining a fierce independence. Some strongholds have formed alliances with other factions, while others remain neutral or wary of outsiders. The Orcs’ traditional way of life is rooted in honor, strength, and self-reliance, making their strongholds key centers of Orcish identity.
