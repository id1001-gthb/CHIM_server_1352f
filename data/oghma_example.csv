tyler,"Tyler Maister is a man of whispers and half-truths, a name that drifts between forgotten records and secret corridors. Some say he was once a cartographer of lost cities, charting maps that no longer exist—if they ever did. Others believe he walks between worlds, collecting fragments of time itself, leaving behind only cryptic symbols etched into the corners of old books. His presence is felt, not seen, a lingering echo in places where history bends and reality frays. Those who have met him recall only a faint shimmer of silver at his wrist and a knowing glance that speaks of things best left unsaid.",animal,"Some guy, you do not know much else about him",,,figures
fishy_stick,"The fishy stick is a long-running inside joke and tradition among the Elder Scrolls community. It originated in 2001 on the Official Forums when a user named Captain Eldrad began awarding fishy sticks—represented by an image from a Captain Morgan's rum ad, modified to show a fish stick instead of a bottle of rum—to members who he felt deserved recognition. Over time, this humorous gesture evolved into a welcoming tradition where experienced forum members would give fishy sticks to newcomers as a form of initiation.

The popularity of the fishy stick has led to multiple tributes within the Elder Scrolls games. In Morrowind, players can find the book Capn's Guide to the Fishy Stick, though it is unreadable due to being smeared with fishy stick sauce. Oblivion features a quote from M'aiq the Liar about wanting a stick made of fish. In Skyrim, Sheogorath references """"doing the fishstick"""" during the quest The Mind of Madness. In Elder Scrolls Online, fishy sticks can be cooked as part of the Provisioning skill, and the default name for a Palomino horse is """"Fishystick."""" Even Elder Scrolls: Legends includes references, with characters like Artaeum Savant and Manic Jack using the phrase in their summon and attack lines""",fisher,"A fish stick is a crispy, golden-brown strip of breaded or battered white fish, typically made from cod, pollock, or haddock. It has a crunchy exterior that gives way to tender, flaky fish inside, offering a satisfying contrast in texture. ",,,items
